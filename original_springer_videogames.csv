The ontology of videogames,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-024-04774-x,23 September 2024,Alexandre Declos,"What are the identity and persistence conditions of videogames? This paper surveys the contemporary philosophical literature on this topic. Specifically, I discuss various views which attempt to ground the identity of videogame works in their rules, in their algorithmic structure, in their source code, or in contextual parameters surrounding gameplay. While these proposals all have merits of their own, I argue that none of them are satisfactory. My conclusion is therefore negative: we still lack an adequate theoretical model to account for the identity and persistence conditions of videogames."
Children’s social problem-solving skills in playing videogames and traditional games: A systematic review,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-023-11663-2,22 February 2023,"Eyüp Yılmaz, Mark D. Griffiths","Playing games can be one of the most important activities for children to improve their social problem-solving (SPS) skills. Studies that have examined the empirical evidence of playing games concerning children’s SPS skills have tended to focus on the function of a single game. Therefore, an overview study is needed to generalize the data by the game content and production purpose. Twelve databases were systematically searched. Four basic criteria were sought for studies to be included. A total of 35 studies meeting all the inclusion criteria were reviewed. The results showed that (i) experimental designs were the most utilized, and (ii) more studies using active control groups are needed to compare the effectiveness of the game playing. In non-traditional games research, half of the videogames used in the studies reviewed and classified, were primarily produced for educational purposes, followed by serious games (30%) and entertainment games (20%). These three types of videogames were effective in promoting children’s SPS skills. Moreover, simulation games were the most preferred videogame genre utilized by the researchers. In studies using videogames, children’s SPS skills did not differ significantly by gender, whereas in a study using traditional games (non-video games), male participants’ problem-solving ability progressed significantly more than that of females. Almost all the studies concluded that playing both videogames and traditional games positively influenced children’s SPS skills. However, only three studies utilizing traditional games were conducted during the two-decade period (2000–2019) and more studies are needed for comparable and generalizable results."
Digital Supply Chain Management in the Videogames Industry: A Systematic Literature Review,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40869-020-00118-0,04 December 2020,"Stephen Kelly, Vojtech Klézl, John Israilidis, Neil Malone, Stuart Butler","As industries mature, they rely more heavily on supply chain management (SCM) to ensure effective operations leading to greater levels of organisational performance. SCM has been widely covered in many industrial areas and, in line with other burgeoning sectors such as Tourism, an industry focus provides the opportunity to look in-depth at the context-based factors that affect SCM. Developments in digital distribution and rapid technological innovations have resulted in an increased focus on Digital Supply Chains (DSCs), which bring about significant changes to how consumers, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers interact, affecting supply chain design and processes. Through a systematic review of the Videogames Industry Supply Chain Management literature, which serves as a pertinent contextual example of a DSC, we look at how supply chains are affected by structural, market and technological change, such as increased platformisation, disintermediation and the proliferation of digital distribution. We distil these findings into a new research agenda, which identifies themes in line with extant DSC research, provides a series of relevant practice recommendations and identifies opportunities for future research."
From Videogames to Teaching — Different Camera Perspectives in an Interactive Synchronous Online Tutorial,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40670-023-01833-9,20 July 2023,"David Niklas Boten, Nils Daum, Thomas Schutz, Sebastian Spethmann","The global COVID-19 pandemic has required clinical skills training to be transferred to an online format. An interactive synchronous online tutorial with different camera perspectives was developed. In a survey, 79% of the students preferred the first-person perspective, which allowed students to view the abdominal examination through the examiner’s eyes."

Motivation Outcomes in Math-Related Videogames,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10758-020-09450-w,13 June 2020,"Daniel L. Hoffman, Seungoh Paek, Zhou Zhou, Selen Türkay","This study examined the relationship between elementary students’ domain-specific and game-specific motivations in the context of educational videogames. Using a quasi-experimental design, thirty (N = 30) sixth grade students were assigned to two groups based on their level of motivation for the domain of math (higher math motivation vs. lower math motivation). They then played a videogame involving mathematics fifteen times over a two-week period. During this time, participants’ in-game performances were recorded, along with their levels of motivation for the videogame and the domain of math. The results showed that the participants played the game at the same level of skill regardless of their initial level of motivation for the domain of math. Similarly, participants expressed high levels of interest, effort, pressure, and value for the game despite their varied levels of math motivation. However, the two groups reported significantly different levels of perceived competence involving the videogame. Further still, participants with lower levels of motivation for math reported a significant decrease in their self-reported ability perceptions in math, which did not occur for participants with higher levels of motivation for math. The study concludes with a discussion of the relationship between learners’ domain-specific and game-specific motivations and the implications for future game-based learning research."
Students’ perceptions about the use the videogames in secondary education,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-020-10122-6,29 January 2020,"Verónica Marín-Díaz, Begoña E. Sampedro-Requena, Magdalena López-Pérez","Working with videogames in class is becoming a normal reality which truly depends on the vision that the teacher possesses about it. But what do receptive students really think about the education mediated by videogames? The current paper introduces the assessment that a group of students from Secondary Education has done (N = 207) about the usage of videogames in the classes. Also, it allows drawing the user profile that the direct-grant schools present. The method used has been descriptive and correlated developed by means of a questionnaire composed by 37 items. The main result obtained shows that the students from the first courses in this educational level are more given to the usage of videogames for their curricular development. Also, we found significant differences in the use of video games in favour of men. Moreover, it is highlighted the profile of low videogames consumer that these students have, questioning whether this will be determined by the type of school in which this research has been carried out. Thus, we present a line of study that links the vision of the videogames and the type of school in which they are studied, since this, among other aspects, is determined by the family purchasing power."
"Videogame training increases clinical well-being, attention and hippocampal-prefrontal functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41398-024-02945-5,28 May 2024,"Maxi Becker, Djo J. Fischer, Simone Kühn, Jürgen Gallinat","Recent research shows that videogame training enhances neuronal plasticity and cognitive improvements in healthy individuals. As patients with schizophrenia exhibit reduced neuronal plasticity linked to cognitive deficits and symptoms, we investigated whether videogame-related cognitive improvements and plasticity changes extend to this population. In a training study, patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls were randomly assigned to 3D or 2D platformer videogame training or E-book reading (active control) for 8 weeks, 30 min daily. After training, both videogame conditions showed significant increases in sustained attention compared to the control condition, correlated with increased functional connectivity in a hippocampal-prefrontal network. Notably, patients trained with videogames mostly improved in negative symptoms, general psychopathology, and perceived mental health recovery. Videogames, incorporating initiative, goal setting and gratification, offer a training approach closer to real life than current psychiatric treatments. Our results provide initial evidence that they may represent a possible adjunct therapeutic intervention for complex mental disorders."
Young videogamers and their approach to science inquiry,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40536-023-00178-4,31 July 2023,"Francesco Avvisati, Francesca Borgonovi","Written instructions seldom need to be read when playing videogames. Instead, gaming often involves early information foraging and expansive exploration behaviors. We use data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) to explore whether students who regularly play videogames (daily gamers) adopt behaviors that are typical of gaming while they complete a computer-based assessment of science and if such behaviors matter for performance in procedural science knowledge."
Toward emotional interactive videogames for children with autism spectrum disorder,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-020-00725-8,24 June 2020,"Sandra Baldassarri, Liliana Passerino, Silvia Ramis, Inma Riquelme, Francisco J. Perales","Technology and videogames have been proven as motivating tools for working attention and complex communication skills, especially in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this work, we present two experiences that used interactive games for promoting communication and attention. The first game considers emotions in order to measure children’s attention, concentration and satisfaction, while the second uses tangible tabletops for fostering cognitive planning. The analysis of the results obtained allows to propose a new study integrating both, in which the tangible interactive game is complemented with the emotional trainer in a way that allows identifying and classifying children’s emotion with ASD when they collaborate to solve cognitively significant and contextualized challenges. The first application proposed is an emotional trainer application in which the child can work out the seven basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise and neutral). Further, a serious videogame is proposed: a 3D maze where the emotions can be captured. The second case study was carried out in a Special Education Center, where a set of activities for working cognitive planning was proposed. In this case, a tangible interactive tabletop was used to analyze, in students with ASD, how the communication processes with these interfaces affect to the attention, memory, successive and simultaneous processing that compose cognitive planning from the PASS model. The results of the first study, suggest that the autistic children did not act with previous planning, but they used their perception to adjust their actions a posteriori (that explains the higher number of collisions). On the second case study, the successive processing was not explored. The inclusion of the mazes of case study 1 to a semantic rich scenario could allow us to measure the prior planning and the emotions involved in the maze game. The new physiological sensors will also help to validate the emotions felt by the children. The first study has as objective the capability to imitate emotions and resolve a maze without semantic context. The second study organized all the actions from a semantic context close to users. The attention results presented by the second study are coherent with the first study and complement it showing that attention can be receptive or selective. In the first study case, the receptive attention was the focus of analysis. In the second case, both contributed to explain and understand how it can be developed from a videogame."

Unravelling cognitive processing of in-game brands using eye tracking and electroencephalography: incongruence fosters it,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04970-x,14 July 2023,"Irene Aliagas, Jesús Privado, Mª Dolores Merino","Videogames have become the world’s favorite pastime, which is why brands integrate their logos on them, a technique called product placement. While most research has focused on analyzing whether brands are memorized based on their presentation within the videogame, little is known about how they are perceived and cognitively processed. This article analyzes whether attention and cognitive load from the placement and the videogame mediate the relationship between prominence, congruence, and familiarity of the brands and their memorization. A preliminary study made it possible to find the brands to be placed (n = 180), while the main study was experimental (n = 160), with prominence and congruence as between-subject factors and familiarity as a within-subject factor. Applying eye tracking and electroencephalogram, the results indicate that when the brand inserted via product placement is incongruent with the videogame genre, it will draw attention, demand cognitive resources, and will be more likely to be remembered and recognized. This would happen with both familiar and unfamiliar brands, and all of this without prominence influencing the process. These findings suggest that incongruent in-game brands would be the first game elements to be cognitively processed, even when they are irrelevant to game achievement."
Between death and suffering: resolving the gamer’s dilemma,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-023-09711-z,07 July 2023,"Thomas Coghlan, Damian Cox","The gamer’s dilemma, initially proposed by Luck (Ethics and Information Technology 11(1):31–36, 2009) posits a moral comparison between in-game acts of murder and in-game acts of paedophilia within single-player videogames. Despite each activity lacking the obvious harms of their real-world equivalents, common intuitions suggest an important difference between them. Some responses to the dilemma suggest that intuitive responses to the two cases are based on important differences between the acts themselves or their social meaning. Others challenge the fundamental assumptions of the dilemma. In this paper, we identify and explore key imaginative and emotional differences in how certain types of in-game violence are experienced by players, consider how these differences factor into the moral lives of players, and use these insights to resolve the dilemma. The view we develop is that the key moral emotion in offensive video gameplay is self-repugnance. This is not repugnance of the act one directs a game character to perform in the game, nor repugnance of the character one plays. It is repugnance of oneself in playing the game. If self-repugnance is a fitting emotional response to playing a videogame, then this is prima facie grounds for thinking it is wrong to play the videogame. Our approach to the gamer’s dilemma is to distinguish the fittingness conditions of self-repugnance from the fittingness conditions of other moral emotions as they pertain to playing videogames. We argue that because of the virtual character of the actions performed in video games, self-repugnance is a fitting response to particular kinds of offensive gameplay. On the other hand, in-game murder is not invariably a fitting ground for self-repugnance. We argue that this difference is grounded in imaginative responses to the harm of death and the harms of profound suffering. Our task is to explain and justify this difference in fittingness conditions and use this to resolve the gamer’s dilemma."
Systematic literature review of digital resources to educate on gender equality,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-022-11574-8,02 February 2023,"Alma Gloria Barrera Yañez, Cristina Alonso-Fernández, Baltasar Fernández-Manjón","Violence and discrimination against women are serious problems that affect today's society regardless of culture or social environment. Educational and government programs addressing these gender issues are difficult to scale up, insufficient or, in some cases, nonexistent. Digital resources can contribute to address discrimination against women and different technological initiatives are being carried out around the world. Videogames and digital resources have proven their effectiveness as tools to educate, prevent and raise awareness about social problems. This article presents a systematic literature review of digital resources such as videogames, apps and simulations that address gender issues including violence and stereotypes. Throughout the review, we analyze multiple characteristics of the resources found (development tools, platforms, location, target audience) to classify the studies found. The main goal of this review is to present the status of gender-focused digital resources, their evaluation studies, including the metrics used and samples, as well as the acceptance and impact of their application. Most of the studies reviewed aimed to raise awareness about gender-based violence using serious games targeted at teenagers. For the resources evaluated, pre-post questionnaires were commonly used. However, many of the projects reviewed did not have evaluation studies or the resources were not openly available, thus limiting their massive application and their potential impact on society. We consider that our results provide a starting point to better understand the role of digital resources in raising awareness about gender issues, highlighting their current limitations, and providing recommendations for future research in gender-based digital resources."
Measuring morality in videogames research,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-019-09515-0,10 October 2019,"Malcolm Ryan, Paul Formosa, Stephanie Howarth, Dan Staines","There has been a recent surge of research interest in videogames of moral engagement for entertainment, advocacy and education. We have seen a wealth of analysis and several theoretical models proposed, but experimental evaluation has been scarce. One of the difficulties lies in the measurement of moral engagement. How do we meaningfully measure whether players are engaging with and affected by the moral choices in the games they play? In this paper, we survey the various standard psychometric instruments from the moral psychology literature and discuss how they might be applied in the evaluation of games."
Trajectories of Screen Time across Adolescence and Their Associations with Adulthood Mental Health and Behavioral Outcomes,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-023-01782-x,06 May 2023,"Xinxin Zhu, Helen Griffiths, Zhuoni Xiao, Denis Ribeaud, Manuel Eisner, Yi Yang, Aja Louise Murray","Excessive screen time among adolescents is discussed as a significant public health concern. Identifying adolescent longitudinal patterns of time spent on regularly-used media screens and understanding their young adulthood mental health and behavioral issue correlates may help inform strategies for improving these outcomes. This study aimed to characterize joint developmental patterns of time spent on videogames, surfing/chatting the Internet, and TV/DVDs during adolescence (at ages 11, 13, 15, 17) and their associations with mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-injury) and behavioral issues (i.e., substance use, delinquency, aggression) in early adulthood (at age 20). A parallel-process latent class growth analysis was used to model data from a diverse community-ascertained sample of youth in Zurich, Switzerland (n = 1521; 51.7% males). Results suggested that a five-class model best fitted the data: (1) low-screen use, 37.6%; (2) increasing chatting/surfing, 24.0%; (3) moderate-screen use, 18.6%; (4) early-adolescence screen use, 9.9%; and (5) increasing videogame and chatting/surfing, 9.9%. After adjusting for baseline levels of outcomes (primarily at age 11), the trajectory groups differed in their associations with adulthood outcomes of mental health and behavioral problems, indicating the importance of problematic screen usage patterns in predicting these outcomes. Future research to test the directionality of these associations will be important. These findings suggest which patterns of screen use may be a marker for later mental health and behavioral issues in different domains."

Changes in Daily Life Habits during COVID-19 and Their Transitory and Permanent Effects on Italian University Students’ Anxiety Level,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-024-10304-1,15 March 2024,"Giovanni Busetta, Maria Gabriella Campolo, Demetrio Panarello","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced increases in mental distress, correlated with fear about the future, economic outlook, labor market situation, restriction of individual freedom and behavioral changes. While some of these are associated with the perceived risk of infection, others are linked to the restrictive measures imposed to limit infections. Whatever the reason behind it, the main question to be asked is whether transitory or habitual anxiety levels are affected and, eventually, whether changes in daily life habits could play a role. To answer this question, a survey was administered to thousands of students from three Italian universities. The survey included a psychological test, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, through which it is possible to observe whether the effects of changes in daily life habits impact on transitory (State) and/or habitual (Trait) levels of anxiety. First, the results show that individuals who are habitually characterized by higher levels of anxiety tend to suffer higher increases in transitory anxiety during the pandemic, and that being a woman is associated with increases in both habitual and current anxiety. Furthermore, physical activity, book reading and self-care practices seem to mitigate the increase in anxiety led by the pandemic. While the first and the last have an impact on habitual and current anxiety levels, book reading is only associated with reductions in current anxiety. Finally, increased use of social networks is associated with greater state anxiety levels, while intensive exposure to videogames and movies amplifies trait anxiety."
Which is the Digital Competence of Each Member of Educational Community to Use the Computer?

Therefore, this study is aimed: (1) to know and compare the digital competence of the agents that are the main integrators of the educational community (parents, teachers, students) about the use of the computers, according to gender and educational stage (Pre-school, Primary and Secondary Education stages); and (2) to identify significant predictors that affect the acquisition of this competence. An ex-post-facto design was used with a sample of 786 participants from Andalusia (Spain). Research methods such as contrasts of means and multiple linear regression analysis were used. The results showed high average levels of basic digital competences for all the agents involved. A gender gap was found between mothers and fathers of students, with higher scores for the latter group. In addition, the use of videogames, the parents' academic background and the use of digital tablets or Google+ are the most significant predictors that affect the acquisition of this competence."

The study enlisted the participation of 166 secondary school students. A quasi-experimental pre-post design with a non-equivalent control group was used. The intervention consisted of a specific training program entailing nine one-hour sessions once a week. To develop the model, the data was analysed using the optimisation technique of partial least squares (PLS). Our findings show that the factors studied, which are accessibility, enjoyment, technological competence and learning through video games, have an impact on students’ acceptance of video games as an educational tool and how this positive relationship leads to enhanced academic performance in physical education."

Informed by an explorative survey (N = 793), interpretive phenomenological analysis was applied to interview data from actively gaming Chinese (n = 10) and Finnish (n = 10) participants. Our findings demonstrate how the general increase of pandemic-time gaming did not manifest in all player groups, but in some life contexts gaming activity rather decreased along with reformations in subjective meaning hierarchies and values. Ultimately, eight subordinate themes were refined into testable hypotheses. The study encourages policies that promote socially supportive gaming during pandemic-like situations to consider including personally meaningful solitary play in their recommendations and highlighting context-specificity over generalization. Finally, as almost all our data points echoing experiences of decreasing gaming activity came from China, we stress the importance of culturally diverse samples in the psychological study of global phenomena."
Behavioral Addictions Questionnaire (BAQ): Validation of a New Tool for the Screening of Multiple Addictive Behaviors in the Italian Population,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-022-00906-x,06 September 2022,"Stefania Mastropietro, Francesca Favieri, Giuseppe Forte, Nicoletta Locuratolo, Daniela Mannarelli, Caterina Pauletti, Francesco Fattapposta, Maria Casagrande","This study deals with the uncertainty in defining behavioral addictions (BAs). BAs are characterized by specific compulsive behaviors, regardless of potential negative consequences. However, to differentiate a behavior from a leisure activity to an addictive one is still an object of debate in the literature. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Behavioral Addictions Questionnaire (BAQ) as a possible screening tool for multiple BAs (i.e., shopping, food addiction, gambling, sex, work, exercise, Internet, videogames, and smartphone). BAQ aims to give a dimensional and quantitative assessment of addictive behaviors in a continuum, including both the adaptive and maladaptive features of the behaviors. Five hundred and seventy-six healthy adults (age range: 18–88) participated in the study, completing a survey including the BAQ questionnaire. Considering both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, statistical examination suggested good psychometric properties, with adequate validity in all its subscales (i.e., the goodness of fit). Moreover, also higher reliability was confirmed for each dimension detected (i.e., all alpha over 0.65). The BAQ represents a comprehensive screening instrument that benefits from appropriate validity and reliability for assessing BAs. Therefore, it can be used in clinical fields and research. Moreover, the feature of BAs on a continuum, and the severity index adopted by the study, can help from a preventive perspective. However, further validation of the BAQ is needed in other countries and contexts."
A Comparative Time-Diary Analysis of UK and US Children’s Screen Time and Device Use,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12187-021-09884-3,02 December 2021,"Killian Mullan, Sandra L. Hofferth","This paper presents the results of a comparative analysis of the time school-age children 8-17 years in the UK and the US spent using devices such as smartphones and tablets, and their time in screen-based activities such as watching TV and playing videogames in 2014-15. The paper draws on innovative instruments measuring children’s time using technology and engaging with screens in these two countries. We find that in both, children’s time using devices overlaps with time in screen-based activities, non-screen leisure, and non-leisure activities. Children in the UK spend more time using devices than children in the US, but family size and the availability of an internet connection at home largely explain major cross-national differences. Children in the US spend less time using computers than children in the UK, and, on non-school days, more time watching TV and playing videogames. These differences remain significant after controlling for a range of child, parent and family-level characteristics. Divergent cross-national patterns for children’s time using relatively new devices and their time in more established screen-based activities are linked to differences in family composition and to differential access."
The one to watch: Heuristic Determinants of Viewership among Influential Twitch Streamers,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10660-022-09589-x,08 August 2022,E. Mitchell Church,"Twitch users watched over 1.2 billion hours of streaming video in a single month in 2020, with the vast majority of these hours devoted to videogames. The most popular streamers who create this content are often powerful influencers in a rapidly growing industry, and many industries now see videogame influencer marketing as a key aspect of their marketing mix. However, while some streamers have amassed incredible popularity on Twitch, the factors that drive live-streaming viewership remain poorly understood. This study empirically examines a large population of Twitch streamers to explore this existing gap in the current research and explain how potential viewers make the decision to patronize a Twitch streamer. Using panel data on the actions and characteristics of Twitch streamers combined with other sources, the study identifies the heuristic cues most associated with successful Twitch streamers. Ultimately, the study identifies and evaluates multiple heuristics around Twitch content delivery practices, with significant implications for any live-streaming context."

One-hundred adults with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) were recruited for a 12-week intervention and randomized to one of three groups: (i) morning exercise (AMEx; 0600–0900); (ii) evening exercise (PMEx; 1600–1900); or (iii) waitlist control. AMEx and PMEx were prescribed self-paced aerobic exercise to achieve a weekly total of 250 min via a combination of supervised and unsupervised training. Sedentary and active behavior times were measured at baseline, mid- and post-intervention using the multimedia activity recall for children and adults. Time spent engaging in physical activity was significantly increased from baseline at both mid- (+ 14–22 min·day−1) and post-intervention (+ 12–19 min·day−1), for AMEx and PMEx. At 12-weeks, participants in both morning and evening exercise groups reported increased time spent Sleeping (+ 36 and + 20 min·day−1, respecitively), and reduced time spent watching TV/playing videogames (− 32 and − 25 min·day−1, respectively). In response to an exercise stimulus, previously inactive adults make encouraging modifications in how they use their time, and the patterns of change are similar with morning and evening exercise."
Cheer for me: effect of non-player character audience feedback on older adult users of virtual reality exergames,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-023-00780-5,13 March 2023,"Kangyou Yu, Shaoyue Wen, Wenge Xu, Maurizio Caon, Nilufar Baghaei, Hai-Ning Liang","The presence of an audience and its feedback could affect people’s performance and experience during an event, especially related to sports such as tennis or boxing. Similarly, in videogames, players’ gameplay could be affected if there is an audience and its feedback in response to players’ performance in the environment. The inclusion of an audience with non-player characters (NPC) is common in videogames in general. However, there is a limited exploration of the use of an NPC audience in virtual reality (VR) exergames, especially focusing on elderly players. To fill this gap, this work examines the effect of an NPC audience and its associated feedback (with/without) on elderly users of VR exergames. In a user study, we used 120 NPC in a virtual audience. Results showed that the presence of the NPC audience with responsive feedback led to higher performance (with a higher success rate of performing gesture actions, more successful combinations of actions (or combos for short) performed, and more opponent’s combos prevented) and better gameplay experience (with higher levels of competence, autonomy, relatedness, immersion, and intuitive controls) of elderly players. Our results can help frame the design and engineering of VR exergames that are targeted at elderly users to help them have an enhanced gameplay experience and improve their health."
Resisting the Gamer’s Dilemma,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09655-w,28 July 2022,"Thomas Montefiore, Paul Formosa","Intuitively, many people seem to hold that engaging in acts of virtual murder in videogames is morally permissible, whereas engaging in acts of virtual child molestation is morally impermissible. The Gamer’s Dilemma (Luck in Ethics Inf Technol 11:31–36, 2009) challenges these intuitions by arguing that it is unclear whether there is a morally relevant difference between these two types of virtual actions. There are two main responses in the literature to this dilemma. First, attempts to resolve the dilemma by defending an account of the relevant moral differences between virtual murder and virtual child molestation. Second, attempts to dissolve the dilemma by undermining the intuitions that ground it. In this paper, we argue that a narrow version of the Gamer’s Dilemma seems to survive attempts to resolve or dissolve it away entirely, since neither approach seems to be able to solve the dilemma for all cases. We thus provide a contextually sensitive version of the dilemma that more accurately tracks onto the intuitions of gamers. However, we also argue that the intuitions that ground the narrow version of the Dilemma may not have a moral foundation, and we put forward alternative non-moral normative foundations that seem to better account for the remaining intuitive difference between the two types of virtual actions. We also respond to proposed solutions to the Gamer’s Dilemma in novel ways and set out areas for future empirical work in this area."
Why do adults seek treatment for gaming (disorder)? A qualitative study,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41599-023-01775-y,06 June 2023,"Veli-Matti Karhulahti, Sanni Behm, Lauri Lukka","Despite gaming disorder now being diagnosable by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as a new mental disorder due to addictive behaviors, little is known about the concrete reasons for which people seek treatment for their videogame play. As the current literature is mainly based on children and adolescents, there is a strong need for better understanding adult treatment-seekers in particular. This preregistered study responds to the gap in research by qualitatively investigating the reasons for treatment-seeking with 110 participants who had sought help for their videogame play from a Finnish treatment program. We applied template analysis to the open-ended data, which consist of the participants’ personal accounts regarding their problems. Additionally, we report the game titles that the participants had problems with, as well as Internet Gaming Disorder Test (IGDT-10) scores, which were measured from 89 participants. The template analysis suggested five themes, which cover the main reasons for treatment-seeking: social reasons, existential reasons, practical reasons, self-perceived addiction, and wish for support. Many of these themes overlap with the ICD-11 description of gaming disorder, but several issues, such as loss of meaning and financial harms, are not part of the current diagnosis. The average IGDT-10 score among participants was 3.86 (SD = 2.55) and 37 (42%) individuals met the disorder cutoff (5.00). Numerous videogames with different designs were mentioned as sources of problems, of which 26 were mentioned more than once. The study indicates that adults seek treatment for many kinds of games and gaming-related problems, including but not limited to those, which are described part of the ICD-11 gaming disorder diagnoses. We recommend both researchers and practitioners to implement an expanded perspective on gaming behaviors, acknowledging that adults may seek treatment for diverse gaming-related problems, some of which not necessarily relevant to gaming disorder or mental disorders in general."
System Thinking in Gamification,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-023-02579-2,28 February 2024,"Anders Nordby, Håvard Vibeto, Sophie Mobbs, Harald U. Sverdrup","People spend a lot of time and energy playing videogames (Kapp in The gamification of learning and instruction: game-based methods and strategies for training and education. Pfeiffer an imprint of Wiley, San Francisco, 2012), and as a result, gamification has grown from a buzzword into a discipline. Since 2012, the authors have experimented with system thinking as a methodology for developing gamification and will present examples in this article. The primary objectives are to study how system thinking can be used to understand, design, develop and document gamifications, and how psychology and pedagogics can be integrated in the process to enhance the learning. This is an observational case study that gives examples of how students (i) use system thinking to understand and clarify the gamification case using system analysis and (ii) use system dynamics to simulate cases and predict user responses. Students begin system analysis once the gamification idea is developed and their goals and the case parameters are established, and it includes making casual loop diagrams, flow charts, and reference behavior patterns. Students then find and experiment with numerical data for the case and use system dynamics to simulate the gamification and predict the user results. The pedagogy is problem based and grounded in traditional problem-based learning and situated learning. This article shows how system thinking allows students and professionals to develop a deeper and more tangible understanding of the research materials and presumptions they have when engaging in any given gamification scenario. System thinking also provides tools to test research material and hypotheses in a more structured, manageable, and palpable way. Although we have discovered several ways system thinking can benefit gamification design, the research has also revealed new areas where system thinking could be explored further."

It is important to know what inherent characteristics of potential surgeons may facilitate robotic surgery training and performance. Findings from previous studies indicate videogames can be inexpensive tools that help improve hand–eye coordination, coordination of 3-D movements with 2-D images, and spatial orientation. In the context of robotic-assisted knee arthroscopy using a MAKO robotic arm, this study explored performance and subjective experiences of novices (N = 104) with a fake bone shaving task at a public event. Participants’ performance was measured based on how much of the bone they successfully shaved. Findings showed that duration of videogame play per week was negatively related to performance with the robotic arm. Male and female participants performed similarly on the bone shaving task, and reported similar difficulty with and enjoyment of the task. However, female participants who played videogames performed better than those who did not play videogames. Participants who were younger than 11 had the worst performance and the most difficulty with the robotic arm. Overall, the findings indicate that the effect of videogame experience on the performance with the robotic arm may differ based on gender and age. This has implications on the length of training for surgeons of different gender using videogames and other emerging technologies."

In order to go beyond a correlational analysis, we have applied a time fixed-effects estimation using a recent longitudinal database of 15,974 students from the Spanish region of the Canary Islands. Our results show that, in general, an increasingly frequent use of the Internet has a negative influence on students’ academic achievement progression, with higher use of instant messaging applications being particularly linked to girls’ poorer mathematics academic performance progression. This negative influence may be a consequence of replacing time to academic activities (e.g., reading books or homework) with time using the Internet, which can also ultimately lead students to adopt unhealthy study habits that can affect their future academic success. Furthermore, we find that there is not a negative impact of playing videogames on the mathematics competence, as the development of spatial-visual (digital) skills possibly counterbalances the negative influence of time substitution between academically oriented tasks and the Internet."

To study the effect of advertising on the attitudes and gaming behavior of a sample of 2887 Spanish A&Y (12–22 years old), by means of a self-report assessment. On average, participants show a weak effect of advertising, however there are great variations, estimating that 11% of A&Y acknowledge being influenced by advertising and 5% recognize being severely affected. Men see themselves more impacted than women, without age differences. Those who play videogames signal a stronger effect of this kind of advertising and although these differences are not substantial in effect size, they reach statistically significance in 12 of the 13 questions assessed. A&Y who showed higher scores indicating problematic use of videogames in the IDGS9-SF, are those who indicate a greater impact of advertising on their attitudes towards gaming, as well as on the way they play or on their intention to play. These results support the idea that videogames can, albeit modestly, predispose engagement in games of chance."
Analyzing autostereoscopic environment configurations for the design of videogames,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00530-019-00621-z,28 May 2019,"José Martínez Sotoca, Miguel Chover, Inmaculada Remolar, Ricardo Loreto","Stereoscopic devices are becoming more popular every day. The 3D visualization that these displays offer is being used by videogame designers to enhance the user’s game experience. Autostereoscopic monitors offer the possibility of obtaining this 3D visualization without the need for extra device. This fact makes them more attractive to videogame developers. However, the configuration of the cameras that make it possible to obtain an immersive 3D visualization inside the game is still an open problem. In this paper, some system configurations that create autostereoscopic visualization in a 3D game engine were evaluated to obtain a good accommodation of the user experience with the game. To achieve this, user tests that take into account the movement of the player were carried out to evaluate different camera configurations, namely, dynamic and static converging optical axis and parallel optical axis. The purpose of these tests is to evaluate the user experience regarding visual discomfort resulting from the movement of the objects, with the purpose of assessing the preference for one configuration or the other. The results show that the users tend to have a preference trend for the parallel optical axis configuration set. This configuration seems to be optimal because the area where the moving objects are focused is deeper than in the other configurations."

However, less is currently known about the long-term interrelations between need-supportive videogame play, global need satisfaction, and adolescent well-being. Thus, guided by self-determination theory and broaden-and-build theory, this study explored the longitudinal reciprocal relationship between adolescents’ need-supportive gameplay and self-esteem, via global need satisfaction. The moderating effect of gender was also examined. Three-wave panel data were collected from 405 Belgian adolescents between September 2021 and September 2022 (M age = 15.13, SD = 1.52; Female = 64.20%), and data were analyzed using random intercept cross-lagged panel models. The valence, strength, and consistency of within-person cross-lagged associations differed across the basic psychological needs, and gender had no moderating effect on the hypothesized models. Results therefore suggest that the uniform positive effects of need-supportive gameplay on adolescent well-being tend to be short-lived, and that over time, videogame play tends to satisfy some basic psychological needs more than others. Findings add to the emerging literature regarding videogame play and positive adolescent well-being, and results emphasize the importance of investigating the long-term implications of adolescent videogame play."

Only empirical studies were included and were also assessed for potential biases using the ROBUST guidelines. A total of 30 studies from eight countries were included in the review. Esports gamblers were found more likely to be young males, likely to score high on problematic gambling scales, and likely to belong to households speaking a non-English language at home in English speaking countries. Esports gamblers are a unique type of gambling population, with rare characteristics and behaviors compared to other types of gamblers. Given the limited number of studies, there is a need for further research in this field to understand these populations, as well as the need for longitudinal research."

The sample consisted of 439 students from Compulsory Secondary Education, (238 boys and 201 girls), aged between 13 and 18. Exposure to video games was assessed through an author-elaborated questionnaire, violence justification, and pathological video-gaming were evaluated with the Exposure to Violence Questionnaire and the Assessment of Pathological Computer-Gaming, respectively, and CPV was assessed through the Child-to-Parent Aggression Questionnaire. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that pathological video-gaming and, specially, justification of violence, were related to the perpetration of CPV against both mothers and fathers. However, a relationship of exposure to violent video games and violence on TV with the perpetration of CPV was not found. These results suggest a potential new target for CPV prevention, as well as for the treatment of juvenile offenders."

This article reports on a systematic review aimed at providing an overview of different approaches in this context, describing their effectiveness, and thematically comparing learning outcomes across different undergraduate programs. The authors searched PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for articles published between 2000 and January 2021. Quantitative and qualitative studies that reported on outcomes related to learners’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes following an intervention with virtual patients in undergraduate psychiatry education were reviewed. Outcomes were thematically compared, and a narrative synthesis of the different outcomes and effectiveness was provided. Of 7856 records identified, 240 articles were retrieved for full-text review and 46 articles met all inclusion criteria. There were four broad types of virtual patient interventions: case-based presentation (n = 17), interactive virtual patient scenarios (n = 14), standardized virtual patients (n = 10), and virtual patient videogames (n = 5). The thematic analysis revealed that virtual patients in psychiatry education have been used for learners to construe knowledge about symptomatology and psychopathology, develop interpersonal and clinical communicative skills, and to increase self-efficacy and decrease stigmatizing attitudes towards psychiatric patients. In comparison with no intervention, traditional teaching, and text-based interventions, virtual patients were associated with higher learning outcomes. However, the results did not indicate any superiority of virtual patients over non-technological simulation. Virtual patients in psychiatry education offer opportunities for students from different health disciplines to build knowledge, practice skills, and improve their attitudes towards individuals with mental illness. The article discusses methodological shortcomings in the reviewed literature. Future interventions should consider the mediating effects of the quality of the learning environment, psychological safety, and level of authenticity of the simulation."
Perceived parental psychological control and the risk of internet gaming disorder in adolescents: a cross-sectional study,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-05951-4,18 April 2024,"Nazan Turan, Afra Alkan, Yasemin Çekiç","It is stated that parental psychological control (PC), which appears to hinder psychological development in children and adolescents, is associated with internet gaming disorder (IGD). However, parenting styles and practices vary across cultures. For this reason, to determine the risk of IGD in adolescents who are in the process of psychological development and to prevent it at an early stage, there is a need to better understand the effect of PC on the development of IGD. In this context, this study aims to examine the impact of perceived parental psychological control on the risk of Internet gaming disorder in Turkish adolescents. A cross-sectional design was used. The sample group consisted of 4498 students from eight public high schools in Turkey. Participant Information Form, the Psychological Control Scale, and the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale Short Form were used for collecting data. Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the risk of IGD increased as maternal disrespect-maternal psychological control and father disrespect scores increased. Paternal psychological control score had no significant effect on IGD risk. In the multivariate model, age, father’s education level, spending money on games, time spent playing daily games on weekdays and weekends, and father’s psychological score were found to be associated with IGD risk. The effects of maternal disrespect and maternal psychological control scores on the IGD risk varied according to the number of siblings and the education level of the mother. As a result, parental PC was determined to affect the risk of IGD in Turkish adolescents significantly."

Its main consequences are the loss of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity of the amblyopic eye and binocular vision impairments. During the last years videogames have been used as a therapeutic tool for amblyopia with the inconclusive results. The present work has assessed the effectiveness of a virtual reality videogame (AmbliOK®) in the neurorehabilitation of four adult clinical cases with anisometropic amblyopia. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereopsis and interocular suppression were assessed before, during, immediately after, one month and one year (in one patient) after the training. The intervention was conducted along four weeks (10 h) and yielded the variable results. In general, all patients showed an improvement in visual functions although not all ameliorated in the same way. Visual acuity measures improved in all patients, falling outside the amblyopia criterion at the end of the treatment. However, the improvement was not maintained one month later in two patients. Contrast sensitivity progressively improved for the amblyopic and the fellow eyes with all patients showing better results one month after the treatment. The patient assessed one year after still showed better results than in the baseline. Patients showing bad stereopsis in the baseline reached a performance considered normal one month and even one year after the treatment. The effectiveness of the treatment seems to be related to the characteristics of patients."

Preliminary evidence has suggested a common pattern of ED and substance use, especially alcohol. Additional evidence has been accumulating very fast; in addition, other lifestyle and risky behaviors may contribute to shed light on the complex interplay of factors involved in ED consumption. We have undertaken a comprehensive systematic review of the evidence on psychosocial correlates of ED consumption in 0–18 years subjects, as published up to April 1, 2021, in MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Reviews and Central Register of Controlled Trials, which allowed to select 104 original articles. Only ~ 10% of the papers provided results based on longitudinal analyses. A common pattern of ED consumption and polysubstance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and soft and hard drugs, was still confirmed in adolescents; violent and risky behaviors were also related to a higher ED consumption. In addition, frequent ED consumers are more likely to have bad dietary habits, including consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and junk foods. A generally inconclusive evidence was found for sport/physical activities, although sedentary behaviors were generally related to ED consumption."

In light of this need, many scholars have looked towards museums, arguing that as trusted institutions of informal learning, museums are uniquely positioned to support public engagement with contentious, impactful issues like climate change. However, while several museum exhibits have emerged over recent years, empirical research on museum-based learning experiences remains quite limited. We take a step towards advancing understanding of museum-based climate change learning through an empirical investigation at a natural history museum in the US. This study examines learners’ collaborative discourse within one exhibit about climate change, a multiplayer video game called Utah Climate Challenge (UCC). Investigating moments of failure and struggle, we analyze learners’ forms of collaboration through moment-to-moment discourse analysis. Findings demonstrate the importance of scaffolding multiple types of collaboration, as well as the potential for a collaborative, museum-based videogame to support learning of important science concepts relevant to climate change."

Findings supported (i) the four-dimensional first-order factor structure, (ii) full scalar invariance across age groups and partial scalar equivalence across gender, and (iii) reliability and criterion validity of the VASC. The construct validity of the VASC was confirmed by the identification of two distinct profiles (high videogame players vs. low videogame players) and their specific patterns of associations with personality traits and social self-concept. Interaction effects of gender × profiles on personality traits were evidenced. Overall, the findings provided validity for the use of the Italian version of the VASC and extending the body of literature on videogame addiction."
Location attributes explaining the entry of firms in creative industries: evidence from France,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-022-01196-w,05 April 2023,"Josep-Maria Arauzo-Carod, Eva Coll-Martínez, Camelia Turcu",This paper focuses on creative industries and the role played by the existing spatial distribution and agglomeration economies of these activities in relation to their entry decisions. We rely on employment and firm-level data in the creative industries (provided by INSEE) and compare the location of new establishments in the creative and non-creative industries between 2009 and 2013 in French departments (NUTS 3 regions). We use count data models and spatial econometrics to show that location determinants are rather similar in creative and non-creative industries and that specialisation in creative industries positively influences the entry of all other industries. The French case provides new insights to understand the geographical patterns of creative industries.
"Can risky behaviors, gaming addiction, and family sense of coherence accurately classify gender among university students?",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-020-01284-0,03 January 2021,"Mustafa Savci, Mustafa Ercengiz, Banu Yildiz, Mark >D. Griffiths, Ferda Aysan","The present study examined whether risky behaviors, gaming addiction, and family sense of coherence classify female and male university students correctly. For this purpose, Logistic Regression Analysis (LRA) was used. The main purpose of LRA is to estimate which group the individual is a member of. LRA is widely used to predict categorical data (i.e., male and female, addicted and non-addicted, single and married). The present study comprised 281 university students (148 females and 133 males) who had been playing digital videogames for at least six months. The measures used included the Risk Behaviors Scale, Digital Game Addiction Scale, and Family Sense of Coherence Scale-Short Form. Analysis demonstrated that risky behavior, gaming addiction, and family sense of coherence predicted gender with 76.5% accuracy. In other words, risky behaviors, gaming addiction, and family sense of coherence scores can predict a high probability that an individual is male or female. More specifically, risky behaviors (school dropout, antisocial behaviors, alcohol use, smoking, and eating habits) and gaming addiction contributed significantly to the classification of an individual being male or female. The biggest contribution in the classification of gender was digital gaming addiction. Family sense of coherence and risky behaviors such as substance use and suicide tendency did not contribute significantly to gender classification. The present study provided important resulted in terms of demonstrating risk factors related to gender."
Personality differences between videogame vs. non-videogame consumers using the HEXACO model,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-020-00793-2,19 May 2020,"Amir Zaib Abbasi, Ding Hooi Ting, Helmut Hlavacs, Bradley Wilson, Umair Rehman, Ali Arsalan","This study investigates whether there exist personality differences between consumers of videogames and non-consumers of videogames. This is explored through the HEXACO model, which derives HEXACO scores indicative of a particular personality profile. The model assesses the dimensions of honesty-humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. The investigation utilized a causal-comparative approach to examine personality differences. A sample of 855 teenage students attending private and public institutions in the Perak and Selangor states of Malaysia participated in the study. The sample contained 475 non-videogame consumers and 380 videogame consumers. The study revealed that videogame consumers have a personality profile that is significantly different on agreeableness, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience compared to non-videogame consumers. Our study is first to utilize the HEXACO model to evaluate personality differences between videogame consumers and non-videogame consumers."
Impact of AI-assisted music classification in video games for sustaining effectiveness,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-023-08093-0,17 April 2023,Yang Xia,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications are being used in every aspect of life as information technology develops and advances. Music is one of these applications that has gotten a lot of attention in the previous several years. AI-based creative and clever solutions have altered the music industry. These technologies make it incredibly easy for composers to create high-quality music. Artificial intelligence and music (AIM) is a new field that is being utilized to create and manage sounds for a variety of media, including the Internet, video games, and so on. Sounds in games are incredibly effective and can be made even more appealing with the use of AI techniques. The quality of the game's noises has a direct impact on the player's productivity and enjoyment. Game designers can use computer-assisted technologies to create sounds for various scenarios or situations in a game, such as horror, suspense, and conveying information to the player. A game's useful and effective audio can assist visually challenged players during various game events. A high level of musicology knowledge is required for better music creation and composition. AIM has made a variety of sophisticated and interactive tools available for efficient and effective music learning. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the literature on AI-assisted music classification in video games. The study exhibited literature analysis from a variety of viewpoints, which will be used by researchers to develop new solutions in the sector."
Longitudinal Dynamic Relationships Between Videogame Use and Symptoms of Gaming Disorder and Depression Among Chinese Children and Adolescents,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-024-02068-6,12 August 2024,"Mengmeng Zhang, Qian Nie, Wenting Ye, Yifan Wang, Zhiwei Yang, Zhaojun Teng","Although previous studies have shown a close relationship between gaming disorder and depressive symptoms, few have measured normal videogame use, symptoms of gaming disorder, and depressive symptoms concurrently. The longitudinal dynamics between these variables remain unclear. This study used two demographic cohorts to examine the longitudinal relationship between gaming and depressive symptoms: children (n = 1513, 46.9% girls, Mage ± SD = 9.63 ± 0.58 years) and adolescents (n = 1757, 48.5% girls, Mage ± SD = 12.55 ± 0.70 years). Random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) were employed to distinguish between within- and between-person levels of gaming and depressive symptoms. The RI-CLPM results showed a stable link between symptoms of gaming disorder and depression at the between-person level for both children and adolescents. At the within-person level, among children, depressive symptoms positively predicted subsequent gaming disorder symptoms, but gaming disorder symptoms were not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms at this level. Among adolescents, there was no significant cross-lagged effect between symptoms of gaming disorder and depression at the within-person level. Additionally, there was no significant cross-lagged effect between normal videogame use and depressive symptoms in either cohort. These results highlight the different effects of normal videogame use and gaming disorder symptoms associated with depressive symptoms. The different effects on children and adolescents underscore the importance of considering the different developmental stages in the study of gaming and mental health outcomes."
Online Gaming Addiction and Basic Psychological Needs Among Adolescents: The Mediating Roles of Meaning in Life and Responsibility,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-022-00994-9,10 January 2023,"Alican Kaya, Nuri Türk, Hasan Batmaz, Mark D. Griffiths","Individuals whose basic needs are naturally satisfied are much less dependent on their environment and more autonomous. Basic psychological needs (i.e., the general motivators of human actions) are significant predictors of online gaming addiction. Moreover, it has been posited that meaning and responsibility in life are at the center of life from an existential point of view. Therefore, a hypothetical model was tested to examine the relationships between basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness), online gaming addiction, responsibility, and meaning in life. Data were collected from a sample of 546 participants. Mediation analysis was conducted, and the results indicated that basic psychological needs, online gaming addiction, responsibility, and meaning in life had significant negative and positive relationships. The findings indicated that responsibility and meaning in life had a serial mediating effect in the relationship between basic psychological needs and online gaming addiction. The findings also showed that the inverse relationship between online gaming addiction and basic psychological needs was at least partially explained by meaning in life and responsibility. The results of the present study are of great importance and suggest that interventions to satisfy the basic psychological needs of adolescents may help prevent online gaming addiction."
"Longitudinal Relationships Between School Climate, Academic Achievement, and Gaming Disorder Symptoms Among Chinese Adolescents",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-024-01952-5,24 February 2024,"Qian Nie, Zhaojun Teng, Chunyan Yang, Mark D. Griffiths, Cheng Guo","Despite growing concerns regarding the development of gaming disorder symptoms among adolescents, the longitudinal relationship between school factors and gaming disorder symptoms remains far from being fully understood. This two-year longitudinal study examined the relationship between school climate perceptions, academic achievement, and gaming disorder symptoms among three distinct demographic cohorts: preadolescents (n = 1513; 46.9% girls, Mage = 10.64 years, SD = 0.56), early adolescents (n = 1771; 48.3% girls, Mage = 13.54 years, SD = 0.70), and late adolescents (n = 2385; 50.1% girls, Mage = 16.41 years, SD = 0.59). A four-wave study was conducted (six months apart) using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) to separate the within-person (state level) from the between-person (trait level) effects. The results obtained from the RI-CLPMs indicated that fluctuations in school climate perceptions negatively predicted subsequent changes in gaming disorder symptoms among preadolescents at the within-person level, but not among early and late adolescents. Fluctuations relating to gaming disorder symptoms also negatively predicted subsequent changes regarding academic achievement in late adolescents, but not in preadolescents and early adolescents. The effect of school-related factors on gaming disorder symptoms varies across different developmental stages. While preadolescents may represent a particularly susceptible subgroup for gaming disorder in terms of being predicted by their school environment, late adolescents appear to be more vulnerable to predictors of gaming disorder symptoms. The current study also discusses the implications of school-wide programs aimed at improving school climate and preventing the development of gaming disorder symptoms during key developmental periods."

Truth in interactive fiction,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-022-03935-0,21 October 2022,Alex Fisher,"This paper provides an account of truth in interactive fiction. Interactive fiction allows the audience to make choices, resulting in many different possible fictions within each interactive fiction, unlike in literary fiction where there is just one. Adequately capturing this feature of interactive fiction requires us to address familiar issues regarding impossible fiction and the nature of time in fiction. Truth in interactive fiction thus requires a complex account to capture its multitude of fictions. It is argued that a full account of truth in interactive fiction requires distinguishing two works for each interactive fiction, which contain distinct fictional truths. The actual work encompasses what is in fact represented as fictional (hence mistakes can be fictionally true in this work), whilst in the implied work, truth in fiction is governed by authorial intention, hence mistakes are not fictionally true. This dual account best captures our aesthetic evaluation of interactive fictions, for which we often need to distinguish how the work actually is from how it was intended to be."

Griffiths","Over the past two decades, research into Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) has markedly increased due to worldwide spread of online videogames. The reasons and motivations for playing greatly contribute to its popularity. Escapism and avoidance coping strategies have been studied extensively and conceptualized as motives to play. A growing research base has demonstrated a strong association between these motives to play and negative gaming outcomes. Consequently, the aim of the present systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of avoidance coping and escape motives in problematic online gaming. A systematic literature search was carried out using academic databases and a total of 26 empirical studies met the inclusion criteria. The results show that escapism and avoidance coping represent both a predictor of IGD and play a mediating role between many psychological factors (e.g., self-esteem, loneliness, self-concept, anxiety) and problematic online gaming. However, the review also highlights the paucity of longitudinal studies that hinder the determination of the causal direction of these associations. Despite this limitation, the evidence has important implication for developing more effective prevention programs and clinical interventions."

A unified framework to catalogue and classify digital games based on interaction design and validation through clustering techniques,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-19614-w,21 June 2024,"L. Cormio, T. Agostinelli, M. Mengoni","The digital games industry has grown exponentially due to the diversification of games and the increasing multiplicity of the user target base. The market explosion and the great variety make digital game cataloguing and classification challenging issues whose effectiveness can advance scientific research and address design, development and distribution. Firstly, the present study reviews previous cataloguing for video and serious games through systematic literature review and, joining together the findings from the literature review, develops a unified cataloguing model based on five definitions. This model can aid designers in tailoring their applications and contribute to disseminating game design knowledge in academic research. Then, a matrix that correlates design principles and the cataloguing model’s metadata is applied to the cataloguing model, obtaining a unified classification system. Together, they offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the multifaceted landscape of digital games, addressing the limitations of existing domain-specific approaches and providing a versatile tool for game designers. Research validation exploits a two-stage cluster analysis using agglomerative hierarchical and k-means clustering on the data extracted from a sample of digital games. The results show the framework's effectiveness in categorizing digital games without a clear-cut distinction between video and serious games. The system's application in real-world scenarios suggests its potential to guide game development. Future work will refine the proposal based on feedback from digital game designers, expanding the research scope to include a broader range of games."
"Relationships Between Gaming Disorder, Risk Factors, and Protective Factors Among a Sample of Chinese University Students Utilizing a Network Perspective",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-023-01049-3,25 April 2023,"Li Li, Zhimin Niu, Yuting Song, Mark D. Griffiths, Hu Wen, Zhao Yu, Songli Mei","Research has demonstrated that some risk and protective factors of gaming disorder (GD) have been identified. However, the interaction of GD with risk and protective factors has rarely been examined from a network analysis perspective. Therefore, the present study examined the relationships between GD, risk factors (i.e., social anxiety and fear of missing out), and protective factors (i.e., resilience, authenticity, and family closeness) utilizing a network analysis approach among a sample of Chinese university students. A cross-sectional study with 1364 participants was performed using the Gaming Disorder Test, the short version of Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), the Chinese Trait-State Fear of Missing Out Scale (T-SFoMOSC), the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the Authenticity Scale, and a single item assessing family closeness. Social anxiety, FoMO, and two factors of authenticity (i.e., self-alienation and accepting external influence) had positive relationship with GD, while resilience, authentic living, and family closeness had negative relationship with GD. Social anxiety was identified as the core node in the domain-level network. The item “continuation or escalation of gaming” (gd3) and the item “gaming problems” (gd4) constituted the highest edge weight in the facet-level network. The network comparison demonstrated there were no significant differences in relation to network structures and global strengths between gender. The findings suggest bivariate relationships among GD, risk factors (i.e., social anxiety and fear of missing out), and protective factors (i.e., resilience, authenticity, and family closeness). Interventions for GD must be considered through preventing risk factors and increasing protective factors including improving the gaming motivation and maladaptive cognition to decrease negative emotion (e.g., social anxiety and FoMO), enhancing resilience, authentic living and parent–child relationship, as well as decreasing self-alienation and accepting external influence."

Smeralda, Giorgio Di Lorenzo, Francesco Neri, Simone Rossi, Alessandro Rossi, Emiliano Santarnecchi","Action videogames have been shown to induce modifications in perceptual and cognitive systems, as well as in brain structure and function. Nevertheless, whether such changes are correlated with brain functional connectivity modifications outlasting the training period is not known. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in order to quantify acute and long-lasting connectivity changes following a sustained gaming experience on a first-person shooter (FPS) game. Thirty-five healthy participants were assigned to either a gaming or a control group prior to the acquisition of resting state fMRI data and a comprehensive cognitive assessment at baseline (T0), post-gaming (T1) and at a 3 months’ follow-up (T2). Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analysis revealed a significant greater connectivity between left thalamus and left parahippocampal gyrus in the gamer group, both at T1 and at T2. Furthermore, a positive increase in the rs-FC between the cerebellum, Heschl’s gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus paralleled improvements of in-gaming performance. In addition, baseline rs-FC of left supramarginal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum were associated with individual changes in videogame performance. Finally, enhancement of perceptual and attentional measures was observed at both T1 and T2, which correlated with a pattern of rs-FC changes in bilateral occipito-temporal regions belonging to the visual and attention fMRI networks. The present findings increase knowledge on functional connectivity changes induced by action videogames, pointing to a greater and long-lasting synchronization between brain regions associated with spatial orientation, visual discrimination and motor learning even after a relatively short multi-day gaming exposure."

We report a proof of concept study, especially useful for strabismic patients and/or those with reduced or null stereoacuity. Our novel VR PL strategy is based on a principled approach which included aligning and balancing the perceptual input to the two eyes, dichoptic tasks, exposure to large disparities, scaffolding depth cues and perception for action. We recruited ten adults with normal vision and ten with binocular impairments. Participants played two novel PL games (DartBoard and Halloween) using a VR-HMD. Each game consisted of three depth cue scaffolding conditions, starting with non-binocular and binocular cues to depth and ending with only binocular disparity. All stereo-anomalous participants improved in the game and most (9/10) showed transfer to clinical and psychophysical stereoacuity tests (mean stereoacuity changed from 569 to 296 arc seconds, P < 0.0001). Stereo-normal participants also showed in-game improvement, which transferred to psychophysical tests (mean stereoacuity changed from 23 to a ceiling value of 20 arc seconds, P = 0.001). We conclude that a VR PL approach based on depth cue scaffolding may provide a useful method for improving stereoacuity, and the in-game performance metrics may provide useful insights into principles for effective treatment of stereo anomalies."

A cross-sectional design was performed with a sample of 3356 Spanish women participating in the Riseup-PPD-COVID-19 study. These participants completed an online survey composed of measures of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (EPDS), and PTSD related to COVID-19 (Checklist DSM-5), as well as demographics, exposure to COVID-19, and lifestyles to cope with stress. Regarding results, 47.2% showed depression and a third reported anxiety, whereas moderate scores were observed in PTSD symptoms. The most commonly used strategies to cope with stress in the COVID-19 pandemic were talking with friends and family and increasing time with social networks. Better results in mental health were associated with coping strategies such as talking with family and friends or participating in family activities, physical activity, sleeping well at night, eating healthier, and increasing personal care. Furthermore, poor results in mental health were observed in those participants who increased time with screens, ate fast food, reported substance use, and talked more frequently with health professionals. More symptoms were also observed in younger women, primiparous women, and those who reported more exposure to COVID-19. The results underline the need to strengthen the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04595123."
"Impact of immersive virtual reality games or traditional physical exercise on cardiovascular and autonomic responses, enjoyment and sleep quality: a randomized crossover study",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-024-00981-6,04 March 2024,"Jacobo Á. Rubio-Arias, Alberto Verdejo-Herrero, Luis Andreu-Caravaca, Domingo J. Ramos-Campo","Objectives: To assess the potential of immersive virtual reality (IVR) in achieving moderate exercise intensity, and 2) to examine the acute effects of two IVR exergame sessions (BOXVR and Beat Saber), comparing them with the impact of traditional exercise on heart rate variability (HRV), perceived effort, delayed onset muscle soreness, motivation, and sleep. Materials and methods: A crossover design was used. The participants (n = 22) randomly performed two sessions of IVR and one session of moderate intensity physical activity, each session lasting 30 min. Heart Rate (HR) and HRV, Perceived Exertion Scale, Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, sleep quality, and perceived pain, were evaluated. Results: The cardiac response to the activities was significantly higher when participants performed traditional physical activity as compared to the BOXVR and Beat Saber games. Traditional training provided a different HRV response as compared to Beat Saber (LnRMSSD, p = 0.025; SDNN, p = 0.031). Although the sessions were planned for moderate intensity, BOXVR generated a moderate intensity (49.3% HRreserve), Beat Saber (29.6% HRreserve) a light one, and the Circuit session, a vigorous one (62.9% HRreserve). In addition, traditional training reported higher perceived exertion and pain with less enjoyment. Differences were observed between the exergames. BOXVR resulted in a lower cardiac response (HRmax and HRmean), and a higher perception of exertion and pain at 72 h. The sleep variables analyzed were not altered by any of the sessions. Conclusions: BOXVR and traditional training can lead to moderate intensity physical activity. However, traditional training could result in lower adherence to physical exercise programs, as it was perceived as more intense and less enjoyable."

Revisiting the Twentieth Century Through the Lens of Generation X and Digital Games: A Scoping Review,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40869-020-00099-0,11 March 2020,"Hannah R. Marston, María del Carmen Miranda Duro","Video games have been around since the 1960s and have impacted upon society in a myriad of different ways. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify existing literature within the domain of video games which recruited participants from the Generation X (1965–1980) cohort. Six databases were searched (ACM, CINHAL Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) focusing on published journal papers between 1970 and 2000. Search results identified 3186 articles guided by the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR); 4 papers were irretrievable, 138 duplicated papers were removed, leaving 3048 were assessed for eligibility and 3026 were excluded. Articles (n = 22) were included into this review, with four papers primarily published in 1997 and in 1999. Thematic analysis identified five primary themes: purpose and objectives, respective authors’ reporting, technology, ethics and environment) and seven secondary themes: populations, type of participants (e.g. children, students), ethical approval, study design, reimbursement, language, type of assessments. This scoping review is distinctive because it primarily focuses on Generation X, who have experienced and grown-up with videogames, and contributes to several disciplines including: game studies, gerontology and health, and has wider implications from a societal, design and development perspective of video games."
The Role of Self-Esteem in Protecting Against Cyber-Victimization and Gaming Disorder Symptoms Among Adolescents: A Temporal Dynamics Analysis,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-023-01890-8,30 October 2023,"Qian Nie, Mark D. Griffiths, Zhaojun Teng","Previous literature has suggested that victimization is linked to low self-esteem and increases the symptoms of gaming disorder. However, little is known about the intra-individual processes, and the temporal dynamics of cyber-victimization, self-esteem, and gaming disorder symptoms. To address this gap, a three-year longitudinal study was performed using data collected at six different time points from 4206 Chinese adolescents (aged 12–17 years; 50.4% boys). Results of random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) indicated that at the within-person level, the fluctuation in self-esteem weakly predicted late cyber-victimization, and the fluctuation of cyber-victimization also weakly predicted late self-esteem. Additionally, the current study identified an interactive effect between self-esteem and gaming disorder symptoms at the within-person level. Fluctuations in self-esteem negatively predicted late gaming disorder symptoms, and vice versa. However, when combining the three variables (i.e., cyber-victimization, self-esteem, and gaming disorder symptoms) into one RI-CLPM, the results did not support the mediation of self-esteem in the relationship between cyber-victimization and gaming disorder symptoms at the within-person level. Moreover, fluctuations in self-esteem negatively predicted late gaming disorder symptoms and cyber-victimization at the within-person level in the RI-CLPM. These findings emphasize the protective role of self-esteem developed against cyber-victimization and gaming disorder symptoms among adolescents."
"Cognitive, Metacognitive, Motivational, and Emotional Predictors of the Intensity of Internet Gaming Disorder among Adolescents",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11126-024-10075-w,01 July 2024,"Mehdi Akbari, Nima Mohammadaliha, Shahram Mohammadkhani, Mohammad Seydavi, Mark D. Griffiths","Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is multifaceted and can have significant negative consequences. The present study examined the contribution of cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, and emotional factors as predictors for IGD severity. In a cross-sectional study, 703 Iranian adolescents (36.8% females, mean age = 16.98 years [SD = 1.23]) completed an online survey. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, and emotional factors predicted 7.8%, 17.4%, 1.4%, and 1.9% of the variance in IGD symptoms, respectively. The findings indicated that the cognitive factors including some maladaptive cognitions, such as cognitive salience, regret, and perfectionism, and metacognitive factors including some maladaptive metacognitions (negative metacognitions regarding the uncontrollability of online gaming and negative metacognitions regarding the dangers of online gaming) were significant predictors of IGD severity, highlighting their importance in understanding and predicting problematic gaming behaviors. Although contributing to the variance in IGD, motivational factors (escape, coping, and skill development) and emotional factors including emotion regulation (especially reappraisal) played relatively smaller roles compared to cognitive and metacognitive factors. Of the examined predictive factors, metacognitions were the most important predictor of IGD severity. Exploratory moderator analyses showed significant interactions between three predictors of IGD (reappraisal, negative metacognitions, and cognitive salience) with loneliness, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Reappraisal was the most frequent predictor and had a significant interaction with these variables. Other predictors independently impacted IGD irrespective of the level of loneliness, stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms. Based on these findings, special attention to metacognitive, cognitive, emotional, and motivational factors is suggested in the treatment of IGD."

Effects and acceptability of virtual reality to facilitate mindfulness practice in university students,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12528-023-09393-y,17 December 2023,"Marta Modrego-Alarcón, Héctor Morillo, Daniel Campos, María Teresa Navarro-Gil, Jesús Montero-Marín, Alicia Monreal-Bartolomé, Javier García-Campayo, Yolanda López-Del-Hoyo","Mindfulness practices have proven to be effective for improving the mental health of many populations, including university students. However, these practices can be challenging for naive meditators. Virtual reality (VR) can create virtual scenarios that facilitate the practice of mindfulness. This study presents secondary data from a randomized controlled trial on the effects and acceptability of mindfulness-based VR environments conducted with a sample of university students. Specifically, it involved a single condition (n = 93) receiving an intervention that comprised six short mindfulness sessions in VR. Measurements were taken of participants’ state mindfulness and emotional state immediately before and after the implementation of each VR environment. Sense of presence was measured subsequent to each VR environment. Furthermore, participants were asked to rate their expectations for at baseline and satisfaction with the experience after the intervention. Participants significantly improved both state mindfulness and emotional states, and they reported a moderate-to-strong sense of presence in each of the VR environments. Moreover, participants reported high expectation and satisfaction scores for the intervention. This study shows the potential of VR in mindfulness, although there is a need for more research in this area and, in particular, more sophisticated trial designs."

Multisensory GPS impact on spatial representation in an immersive virtual reality driving game,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-022-11124-9,05 May 2022,"Laura Seminati, Jacob Hadnett-Hunter, Richard Joiner, Karin Petrini","Individuals are increasingly relying on GPS devices to orient and find their way in their environment and research has pointed to a negative impact of navigational systems on spatial memory. We used immersive virtual reality to examine whether an audio–visual navigational aid can counteract the negative impact of visual only or auditory only GPS systems. We also examined the effect of spatial representation preferences and abilities when using different GPS systems. Thirty-four participants completed an IVR driving game including 4 GPS conditions (No GPS; audio GPS; visual GPS; audio–visual GPS). After driving one of the routes in one of the 4 GPS conditions, participants were asked to drive to a target landmark they had previously encountered. The audio–visual GPS condition returned more accurate performance than the visual and no GPS condition. General orientation ability predicted the distance to the target landmark for the visual and the audio–visual GPS conditions, while landmark preference predicted performance in the audio GPS condition. Finally, the variability in end distance to the target landmark was significantly reduced in the audio–visual GPS condition when compared to the visual and audio GPS conditions. These findings support theories of spatial cognition and inform the optimisation of GPS designs."

Transparency in Cognitive Training Meta-analyses: A Meta-review,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11065-024-09638-2,19 April 2024,"Alejandro Sandoval-Lentisco, Rubén López-Nicolás, Miriam Tortajada, José Antonio López-López, Julio Sánchez-Meca","Meta-analyses often present flexibility regarding their inclusion criteria, outcomes of interest, statistical analyses, and assessments of the primary studies. For this reason, it is necessary to transparently report all the information that could impact the results. In this meta-review, we aimed to assess the transparency of meta-analyses that examined the benefits of cognitive training, given the ongoing controversy that exists in this field. Ninety-seven meta-analytic reviews were included, which examined a wide range of populations with different clinical conditions and ages. Regarding the reporting, information about the search of the studies, screening procedure, or data collection was detailed by most reviews. However, authors usually failed to report other aspects such as the specific meta-analytic parameters, the formula used to compute the effect sizes, or the data from primary studies that were used to compute the effect sizes. Although some of these practices have improved over the years, others remained the same. Moreover, examining the eligibility criteria of the reviews revealed a great heterogeneity in aspects such as the training duration, age cut-offs, or study designs that were considered. Preregistered meta-analyses often specified poorly how they would deal with the multiplicity of data or assess publication bias in their protocols, and some contained non-disclosed deviations in their eligibility criteria or outcomes of interests. The findings shown here, although they do not question the benefits of cognitive training, illustrate important aspects that future reviews must consider."

Determinants of overfunding in reward-based crowdfunding,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10660-023-09681-w,12 March 2023,Felix Pinkow,"While research on factors contributing to the success of a reward-based crowdfunding project is abundant, research dedicated to projects that were not only successful, but received significantly more funds than initially targeted—overfunded projects—is still scarce. Following a qualitative case-study approach, this study sought to shed light on this phenomenon through examining expert interviews with supporters and team members of an overfunded crowdfunding project considered a critical case. The results are divided into three phases that differentiate characteristics ascribed to the crowd, the project, and the communication. The main findings highlight the central role of the project founders’ reputation and experience, that a positive sentiment among the crowd towards the project must be encouraged and maintained and that the core target group must be correctly identified and attracted. This core target group is crucial for attracting a broader audience, a mechanism that is supported if the project benefits from network effects. A narrative of the project as a vision or ‘dream’ of the project founders thereby contributes to creating a hype and ‘social buzz’. Ultimately, this study contributes to reward-based crowdfunding literature through offering novel insights on project overfunding and illustrating possibilities for new and small ventures how to attract and maintain customers through reward-based crowdfunding."
