The ontology of videogames,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-024-04774-x,23 September 2024,Alexandre Declos,"What are the identity and persistence conditions of videogames? This paper surveys the contemporary philosophical literature on this topic. Specifically, I discuss various views which attempt to ground the identity of videogame works in their rules, in their algorithmic structure, in their source code, or in contextual parameters surrounding gameplay. While these proposals all have merits of their own, I argue that none of them are satisfactory. My conclusion is therefore negative: we still lack an adequate theoretical model to account for the identity and persistence conditions of videogames.",identity persistence conditions videogames paper surveys contemporary philosophical literature topic specifically discuss various views attempt ground identity videogame works rules algorithmic structure source code odds ratio contextual parameters surrounding gameplay proposals merits argue satisfactory conclusion negative lack adequate theoretical model account identity persistence conditions videogames
Children’s social problem-solving skills in playing videogames and traditional games: A systematic review,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-023-11663-2,22 February 2023,"Eyüp Yılmaz, Mark D. Griffiths","Playing games can be one of the most important activities for children to improve their social problem-solving (SPS) skills. Studies that have examined the empirical evidence of playing games concerning children’s SPS skills have tended to focus on the function of a single game. Therefore, an overview study is needed to generalize the data by the game content and production purpose. Twelve databases were systematically searched. Four basic criteria were sought for studies to be included. A total of 35 studies meeting all the inclusion criteria were reviewed. The results showed that (i) experimental designs were the most utilized, and (ii) more studies using active control groups are needed to compare the effectiveness of the game playing. In non-traditional games research, half of the videogames used in the studies reviewed and classified, were primarily produced for educational purposes, followed by serious games (30%) and entertainment games (20%). These three types of videogames were effective in promoting children’s SPS skills. Moreover, simulation games were the most preferred videogame genre utilized by the researchers. In studies using videogames, children’s SPS skills did not differ significantly by gender, whereas in a study using traditional games (non-video games), male participants’ problem-solving ability progressed significantly more than that of females. Almost all the studies concluded that playing both videogames and traditional games positively influenced children’s SPS skills. However, only three studies utilizing traditional games were conducted during the two-decade period (2000–2019) and more studies are needed for comparable and generalizable results.",playing games important activities children improve social problemsolving social problem solving skills studies examined empirical evidence playing games concerning childrens social problem solving skills tended focus function single game overview study needed generalize data game content production purpose databases systematically searched basic criteria sought studies included total studies meeting inclusion criteria reviewed results showed experimental designs utilized ii studies using active control groups needed compare effectiveness game playing nontraditional games research half videogames used studies reviewed classified primarily produced educational purposes followed games entertainment games types videogames effective promoting childrens social problem solving skills simulation games preferred videogame genre utilized researchers studies using videogames childrens social problem solving skills did differ significantly gender study using traditional games nonvideo games male participants problemsolving ability progressed significantly females studies concluded playing videogames traditional games positively influenced childrens social problem solving skills studies utilizing traditional games conducted twodecade period studies needed comparable generalizable results

SCM has been widely covered in many industrial areas and, in line with other burgeoning sectors such as Tourism, an industry focus provides the opportunity to look in-depth at the context-based factors that affect SCM. Developments in digital distribution and rapid technological innovations have resulted in an increased focus on Digital Supply Chains (DSCs), which bring about significant changes to how consumers, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers interact, affecting supply chain design and processes. Through a systematic review of the Videogames Industry Supply Chain Management literature, which serves as a pertinent contextual example of a DSC, we look at how supply chains are affected by structural, market and technological change, such as increased platformisation, disintermediation and the proliferation of digital distribution. We distil these findings into a new research agenda, which identifies themes in line with extant DSC research, provides a series of relevant practice recommendations and identifies opportunities for future research.",industries mature rely heavily supply chain management supply chain management ensure effective operations leading greater levels organisational performance supply chain management widely covered industrial areas line burgeoning sectors tourism industry focus provides opportunity look indepth contextbased factors affect supply chain management developments digital distribution rapid technological innovations resulted increased focus digital supply chains dscs bring significant changes consumers customers suppliers manufacturers interact affecting supply chain design processes systematic review videogames industry supply chain management literature serves pertinent contextual example digital supply chain look supply chains affected structural market technological change increased platformisation disintermediation proliferation digital distribution distil findings new research agenda identifies themes line extant digital supply chain research provides series relevant practice recommendations identifies opportunities future research

They then played a videogame involving mathematics fifteen times over a two-week period. During this time, participants’ in-game performances were recorded, along with their levels of motivation for the videogame and the domain of math. The results showed that the participants played the game at the same level of skill regardless of their initial level of motivation for the domain of math. Similarly, participants expressed high levels of interest, effort, pressure, and value for the game despite their varied levels of math motivation. However, the two groups reported significantly different levels of perceived competence involving the videogame. Further still, participants with lower levels of motivation for math reported a significant decrease in their self-reported ability perceptions in math, which did not occur for participants with higher levels of motivation for math.

After training, both videogame conditions showed significant increases in sustained attention compared to the control condition, correlated with increased functional connectivity in a hippocampal-prefrontal network. Notably, patients trained with videogames mostly improved in negative symptoms, general psychopathology, and perceived mental health recovery.

Toward emotional interactive videogames for children with autism spectrum disorder,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-020-00725-8,24 June 2020,"Sandra Baldassarri, Liliana Passerino, Silvia Ramis, Inma Riquelme, Francisco J. Perales","Technology and videogames have been proven as motivating tools for working attention and complex communication skills, especially in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this work, we present two experiences that used interactive games for promoting communication and attention. The first game considers emotions in order to measure children’s attention, concentration and satisfaction, while the second uses tangible tabletops for fostering cognitive planning. The analysis of the results obtained allows to propose a new study integrating both, in which the tangible interactive game is complemented with the emotional trainer in a way that allows identifying and classifying children’s emotion with ASD when they collaborate to solve cognitively significant and contextualized challenges. The first application proposed is an emotional trainer application in which the child can work out the seven basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise and neutral). Further, a serious videogame is proposed: a 3D maze where the emotions can be captured. The second case study was carried out in a Special Education Center, where a set of activities for working cognitive planning was proposed. In this case, a tangible interactive tabletop was used to analyze, in students with ASD, how the communication processes with these interfaces affect to the attention, memory, successive and simultaneous processing that compose cognitive planning from the PASS model. The results of the first study, suggest that the autistic children did not act with previous planning, but they used their perception to adjust their actions a posteriori (that explains the higher number of collisions). On the second case study, the successive processing was not explored. The inclusion of the mazes of case study 1 to a semantic rich scenario could allow us to measure the prior planning and the emotions involved in the maze game. The new physiological sensors will also help to validate the emotions felt by the children. The first study has as objective the capability to imitate emotions and resolve a maze without semantic context. The second study organized all the actions from a semantic context close to users. The attention results presented by the second study are coherent with the first study and complement it showing that attention can be receptive or selective. In the first study case, the receptive attention was the focus of analysis. In the second case, both contributed to explain and understand how it can be developed from a videogame.",technology videogames proven motivating tools working attention complex communication skills especially children autism spectrum disorder autism spectrum disorder work present experiences used interactive games promoting communication attention game considers emotions order measure childrens attention concentration satisfaction second uses tangible tabletops fostering cognitive planning analysis results obtained allows propose new study integrating tangible interactive game complemented emotional trainer way allows identifying classifying childrens emotion autism spectrum disorder collaborate solve cognitively significant contextualized challenges application proposed emotional trainer application child work seven basic emotions happiness sadness fear disgust anger surprise neutral videogame proposed d maze emotions captured second case study carried special education center set activities working cognitive planning proposed case tangible interactive tabletop used analyze students autism spectrum disorder communication processes interfaces affect attention memory successive simultaneous processing compose cognitive planning planning attention simultaneous successive model results study suggest autistic children did act previous planning used perception adjust actions posteriori explains higher number collisions second case study successive processing explored inclusion mazes case study semantic rich scenario allow united states measure prior planning emotions involved maze game new physiological sensors help validate emotions felt children study objective capability imitate emotions resolve maze semantic context second study organized actions semantic context close users attention results presented second study coherent study complement showing attention receptive odds ratio selective study case receptive attention focus analysis second case contributed explain understand developed videogame

Unravelling cognitive processing of in-game brands using eye tracking and electroencephalography: incongruence fosters it,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04970-x,14 July 2023,"Irene Aliagas, Jesús Privado, Mª Dolores Merino","Videogames have become the world’s favorite pastime, which is why brands integrate their logos on them, a technique called product placement. While most research has focused on analyzing whether brands are memorized based on their presentation within the videogame, little is known about how they are perceived and cognitively processed. This article analyzes whether attention and cognitive load from the placement and the videogame mediate the relationship between prominence, congruence, and familiarity of the brands and their memorization. A preliminary study made it possible to find the brands to be placed (n = 180), while the main study was experimental (n = 160), with prominence and congruence as between-subject factors and familiarity as a within-subject factor. Applying eye tracking and electroencephalogram, the results indicate that when the brand inserted via product placement is incongruent with the videogame genre, it will draw attention, demand cognitive resources, and will be more likely to be remembered and recognized. This would happen with both familiar and unfamiliar brands, and all of this without prominence influencing the process. These findings suggest that incongruent in-game brands would be the first game elements to be cognitively processed, even when they are irrelevant to game achievement.",videogames worlds favorite pastime brands integrate logos technique called product placement research focused analyzing brands memorized based presentation videogame little known perceived cognitively processed article analyzes attention cognitive load placement videogame mediate relationship prominence congruence familiarity brands memorization preliminary study possible brands placed n main study experimental n prominence congruence betweensubject factors familiarity withinsubject factor applying eye tracking electroencephalogram results indicate brand inserted product placement incongruent videogame genre draw attention demand cognitive resources likely remembered recognized happen familiar unfamiliar brands prominence influencing process findings suggest incongruent ingame brands game elements cognitively processed irrelevant game achievement
Between death and suffering: resolving the gamer’s dilemma,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-023-09711-z,07 July 2023,"Thomas Coghlan, Damian Cox","The gamer’s dilemma, initially proposed by Luck (Ethics and Information Technology 11(1):31–36, 2009) posits a moral comparison between in-game acts of murder and in-game acts of paedophilia within single-player videogames. Despite each activity lacking the obvious harms of their real-world equivalents, common intuitions suggest an important difference between them. Some responses to the dilemma suggest that intuitive responses to the two cases are based on important differences between the acts themselves or their social meaning. Others challenge the fundamental assumptions of the dilemma. In this paper, we identify and explore key imaginative and emotional differences in how certain types of in-game violence are experienced by players, consider how these differences factor into the moral lives of players, and use these insights to resolve the dilemma. The view we develop is that the key moral emotion in offensive video gameplay is self-repugnance. This is not repugnance of the act one directs a game character to perform in the game, nor repugnance of the character one plays. It is repugnance of oneself in playing the game. If self-repugnance is a fitting emotional response to playing a videogame, then this is prima facie grounds for thinking it is wrong to play the videogame. Our approach to the gamer’s dilemma is to distinguish the fittingness conditions of self-repugnance from the fittingness conditions of other moral emotions as they pertain to playing videogames. We argue that because of the virtual character of the actions performed in video games, self-repugnance is a fitting response to particular kinds of offensive gameplay. On the other hand, in-game murder is not invariably a fitting ground for self-repugnance. We argue that this difference is grounded in imaginative responses to the harm of death and the harms of profound suffering. Our task is to explain and justify this difference in fittingness conditions and use this to resolve the gamer’s dilemma.",gamers dilemma initially proposed luck ethics information technology posits moral comparison ingame acts murder ingame acts paedophilia singleplayer videogames despite activity lacking obvious harms realworld equivalents common intuitions suggest important difference responses dilemma suggest intuitive responses cases based important differences acts odds ratio social meaning challenge fundamental assumptions dilemma paper identify explore key imaginative emotional differences certain types ingame violence experienced players consider differences factor moral lives players use insights resolve dilemma view develop key moral emotion offensive video gameplay selfrepugnance repugnance act directs game character perform game repugnance character plays repugnance oneself playing game selfrepugnance fitting emotional response playing videogame prima facie grounds thinking wrong play videogame approach gamers dilemma distinguish fittingness conditions selfrepugnance fittingness conditions moral emotions pertain playing videogames argue virtual character actions performed video games selfrepugnance fitting response particular kinds offensive gameplay hand ingame murder invariably fitting ground selfrepugnance argue difference grounded imaginative responses harm death harms profound suffering task explain justify difference fittingness conditions use resolve gamers dilemma

Educational and government programs addressing these gender issues are difficult to scale up, insufficient or, in some cases, nonexistent. Digital resources can contribute to address discrimination against women and different technological initiatives are being carried out around the world. Videogames and digital resources have proven their effectiveness as tools to educate, prevent and raise awareness about social problems. This article presents a systematic literature review of digital resources such as videogames, apps and simulations that address gender issues including violence and stereotypes. Throughout the review, we analyze multiple characteristics of the resources found (development tools, platforms, location, target audience) to classify the studies found. The main goal of this review is to present the status of gender-focused digital resources, their evaluation studies, including the metrics used and samples, as well as the acceptance and impact of their application. Most of the studies reviewed aimed to raise awareness about gender-based violence using serious games targeted at teenagers. For the resources evaluated, pre-post questionnaires were commonly used. However, many of the projects reviewed did not have evaluation studies or the resources were not openly available, thus limiting their massive application and their potential impact on society. We consider that our results provide a starting point to better understand the role of digital resources in raising awareness about gender issues, highlighting their current limitations, and providing recommendations for future research in gender-based digital resources.",violence discrimination women problems affect todays society regardless culture odds ratio social environment educational government programs addressing gender issues difficult scale insufficient odds ratio cases nonexistent digital resources contribute address discrimination women different technological initiatives carried world videogames digital resources proven effectiveness tools educate prevent raise awareness social problems article presents systematic literature review digital resources videogames apps simulations address gender issues including violence stereotypes review analyze multiple characteristics resources development tools platforms location target audience classify studies main goal review present status genderfocused digital resources evaluation studies including metrics used samples acceptance impact application studies reviewed aimed raise awareness genderbased violence using games targeted teenagers resources evaluated prepost questionnaires commonly used projects reviewed did evaluation studies odds ratio resources openly available limiting massive application potential impact society consider results provide starting point better understand role digital resources raising awareness gender issues highlighting current limitations providing recommendations future research genderbased digital resources

Whatever the reason behind it, the main question to be asked is whether transitory or habitual anxiety levels are affected and, eventually, whether changes in daily life habits could play a role. To answer this question, a survey was administered to thousands of students from three Italian universities. The survey included a psychological test, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, through which it is possible to observe whether the effects of changes in daily life habits impact on transitory (State) and/or habitual (Trait) levels of anxiety. First, the results show that individuals who are habitually characterized by higher levels of anxiety tend to suffer higher increases in transitory anxiety during the pandemic, and that being a woman is associated with increases in both habitual and current anxiety. Furthermore, physical activity, book reading and self-care practices seem to mitigate the increase in anxiety led by the pandemic. While the first and the last have an impact on habitual and current anxiety levels, book reading is only associated with reductions in current anxiety. Finally, increased use of social networks is associated with greater state anxiety levels, while intensive exposure to videogames and movies amplifies trait anxiety.",coronavirus disease pandemic produced increases mental distress correlated fear future economic outlook labor market situation restriction individual freedom behavioral changes associated perceived risk infection linked restrictive measures imposed limit infections reason main question asked transitory odds ratio habitual anxiety levels affected eventually changes daily life habits play role answer question survey administered thousands students italian universities survey included psychological test statetrait anxiety inventory possible observe effects changes daily life habits impact transitory state andodds ratio habitual trait levels anxiety results individuals habitually characterized higher levels anxiety tend suffer higher increases transitory anxiety pandemic woman associated increases habitual current anxiety furthermore physical activity book reading selfcare practices mitigate increase anxiety led pandemic impact habitual current anxiety levels book reading associated reductions current anxiety finally increased use social networks associated greater state anxiety levels intensive exposure videogames movies amplifies trait anxiety

The intervention consisted of a specific training program entailing nine one-hour sessions once a week. To develop the model, the data was analysed using the optimisation technique of partial least squares (PLS). Our findings show that the factors studied, which are accessibility, enjoyment, technological competence and learning through video games, have an impact on students’ acceptance of video games as an educational tool and how this positive relationship leads to enhanced academic performance in physical education.",using commercial videogames learning objects development st century skills secondary schools relevant topic study recent years use field physical education especially interesting considering nature artificial intelligence medicine article explore elements like technological competence gamebased learning accessibility enjoyment relevant factors influence acceptance use video games learning aid context physical education influence academic performance subject study enlisted participation secondary school students quasiexperimental prepost design nonequivalent control group used intervention consisted specific training program entailing onehour sessions week develop model data analysed using optimisation technique partial squares partial squares findings factors studied accessibility enjoyment technological competence learning video games impact students acceptance video games educational tool positive relationship leads enhanced academic performance physical education

Informed by an explorative survey (N = 793), interpretive phenomenological analysis was applied to interview data from actively gaming Chinese (n = 10) and Finnish (n = 10) participants. Our findings demonstrate how the general increase of pandemic-time gaming did not manifest in all player groups, but in some life contexts gaming activity rather decreased along with reformations in subjective meaning hierarchies and values. Ultimately, eight subordinate themes were refined into testable hypotheses. The study encourages policies that promote socially supportive gaming during pandemic-like situations to consider including personally meaningful solitary play in their recommendations and highlighting context-specificity over generalization.

Behavioral Addictions Questionnaire (BAQ): Validation of a New Tool for the Screening of Multiple Addictive Behaviors in the Italian Population,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-022-00906-x,06 September 2022,"Stefania Mastropietro, Francesca Favieri, Giuseppe Forte, Nicoletta Locuratolo, Daniela Mannarelli, Caterina Pauletti, Francesco Fattapposta, Maria Casagrande","This study deals with the uncertainty in defining behavioral addictions (BAs). BAs are characterized by specific compulsive behaviors, regardless of potential negative consequences. However, to differentiate a behavior from a leisure activity to an addictive one is still an object of debate in the literature. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Behavioral Addictions Questionnaire (BAQ) as a possible screening tool for multiple BAs (i.e., shopping, food addiction, gambling, sex, work, exercise, Internet, videogames, and smartphone). BAQ aims to give a dimensional and quantitative assessment of addictive behaviors in a continuum, including both the adaptive and maladaptive features of the behaviors. Five hundred and seventy-six healthy adults (age range: 18–88) participated in the study, completing a survey including the BAQ questionnaire. Considering both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, statistical examination suggested good psychometric properties, with adequate validity in all its subscales (i.e., the goodness of fit). Moreover, also higher reliability was confirmed for each dimension detected (i.e., all alpha over 0.65). The BAQ represents a comprehensive screening instrument that benefits from appropriate validity and reliability for assessing BAs. Therefore, it can be used in clinical fields and research. Moreover, the feature of BAs on a continuum, and the severity index adopted by the study, can help from a preventive perspective. However, further validation of the BAQ is needed in other countries and contexts.",study deals uncertainty defining behavioral addictions bas bas characterized specific compulsive behaviors regardless potential negative consequences differentiate behavior leisure activity addictive object debate literature accordingly study aimed assess psychometric properties behavioral addictions questionnaire body appreciation questionnaire possible screening tool multiple bas shopping food addiction gambling sex work exercise internet videogames smartphone body appreciation questionnaire aims dimensional quantitative assessment addictive behaviors continuum including adaptive maladaptive features behaviors seventysix healthy adults age range participated study completing survey including body appreciation questionnaire questionnaire considering exploratory confirmatory factor analyses statistical examination suggested good psychometric properties adequate validity subscales goodness fit higher reliability confirmed dimension detected alpha body appreciation questionnaire represents comprehensive screening instrument benefits appropriate validity reliability assessing bas used clinical fields research feature bas continuum severity index adopted study help preventive perspective validation body appreciation questionnaire needed countries contexts

The paper draws on innovative instruments measuring children’s time using technology and engaging with screens in these two countries. We find that in both, children’s time using devices overlaps with time in screen-based activities, non-screen leisure, and non-leisure activities. Children in the UK spend more time using devices than children in the US, but family size and the availability of an internet connection at home largely explain major cross-national differences. Children in the US spend less time using computers than children in the UK, and, on non-school days, more time watching TV and playing videogames. These differences remain significant after controlling for a range of child, parent and family-level characteristics. Divergent cross-national patterns for children’s time using relatively new devices and their time in more established screen-based activities are linked to differences in family composition and to differential access.",paper presents results comparative analysis time schoolage children years united kingdom united states spent using devices smartphones tablets time screenbased activities watching television playing videogames paper draws innovative instruments measuring childrens time using technology engaging screens countries childrens time using devices overlaps time screenbased activities nonscreen leisure nonleisure activities children united kingdom spend time using devices children united states family size availability internet connection home largely explain major crossnational differences children united states spend time using computers children united kingdom nonschool days time watching television playing videogames differences remain significant controlling range child parent familylevel characteristics divergent crossnational patterns childrens time using relatively new devices time established screenbased activities linked differences family composition differential access

Cheer for me: effect of non-player character audience feedback on older adult users of virtual reality exergames,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-023-00780-5,13 March 2023,"Kangyou Yu, Shaoyue Wen, Wenge Xu, Maurizio Caon, Nilufar Baghaei, Hai-Ning Liang","The presence of an audience and its feedback could affect people’s performance and experience during an event, especially related to sports such as tennis or boxing. Similarly, in videogames, players’ gameplay could be affected if there is an audience and its feedback in response to players’ performance in the environment. The inclusion of an audience with non-player characters (NPC) is common in videogames in general. However, there is a limited exploration of the use of an NPC audience in virtual reality (VR) exergames, especially focusing on elderly players. To fill this gap, this work examines the effect of an NPC audience and its associated feedback (with/without) on elderly users of VR exergames. In a user study, we used 120 NPC in a virtual audience. Results showed that the presence of the NPC audience with responsive feedback led to higher performance (with a higher success rate of performing gesture actions, more successful combinations of actions (or combos for short) performed, and more opponent’s combos prevented) and better gameplay experience (with higher levels of competence, autonomy, relatedness, immersion, and intuitive controls) of elderly players. Our results can help frame the design and engineering of VR exergames that are targeted at elderly users to help them have an enhanced gameplay experience and improve their health.",presence audience feedback affect peoples performance experience event especially related sports tennis odds ratio boxing similarly videogames players gameplay affected audience feedback response players performance environment inclusion audience nonplayer characters nonplayable character common videogames general limited exploration use nonplayable character audience virtual reality virtual reality exergames especially focusing elderly players gap work examines effect nonplayable character audience associated feedback withwithout elderly users virtual reality exergames user study used nonplayable character virtual audience results showed presence nonplayable character audience responsive feedback led higher performance higher success rate performing gesture actions successful combinations actions odds ratio combos short performed opponents combos prevented better gameplay experience higher levels competence autonomy relatedness immersion intuitive controls elderly players results help frame design engineering virtual reality exergames targeted elderly users help enhanced gameplay experience improve health
Resisting the Gamer’s Dilemma,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09655-w,28 July 2022,"Thomas Montefiore, Paul Formosa","Intuitively, many people seem to hold that engaging in acts of virtual murder in videogames is morally permissible, whereas engaging in acts of virtual child molestation is morally impermissible. The Gamer’s Dilemma (Luck in Ethics Inf Technol 11:31–36, 2009) challenges these intuitions by arguing that it is unclear whether there is a morally relevant difference between these two types of virtual actions. There are two main responses in the literature to this dilemma. First, attempts to resolve the dilemma by defending an account of the relevant moral differences between virtual murder and virtual child molestation. Second, attempts to dissolve the dilemma by undermining the intuitions that ground it. In this paper, we argue that a narrow version of the Gamer’s Dilemma seems to survive attempts to resolve or dissolve it away entirely, since neither approach seems to be able to solve the dilemma for all cases. We thus provide a contextually sensitive version of the dilemma that more accurately tracks onto the intuitions of gamers. However, we also argue that the intuitions that ground the narrow version of the Dilemma may not have a moral foundation, and we put forward alternative non-moral normative foundations that seem to better account for the remaining intuitive difference between the two types of virtual actions. We also respond to proposed solutions to the Gamer’s Dilemma in novel ways and set out areas for future empirical work in this area.",intuitively people hold engaging acts virtual murder videogames morally permissible engaging acts virtual child molestation morally impermissible gamers dilemma luck ethics inf technol challenges intuitions arguing unclear morally relevant difference types virtual actions main responses literature dilemma attempts resolve dilemma defending account relevant moral differences virtual murder virtual child molestation second attempts dissolve dilemma undermining intuitions ground paper argue narrow version gamers dilemma survive attempts resolve odds ratio dissolve away entirely approach able solve dilemma cases provide contextually sensitive version dilemma accurately tracks intuitions gamers argue intuitions ground narrow version dilemma moral foundation forward alternative nonmoral normative foundations better account remaining intuitive difference types virtual actions respond proposed solutions gamers dilemma novel ways set areas future empirical work area
Why do adults seek treatment for gaming (disorder)?

As the current literature is mainly based on children and adolescents, there is a strong need for better understanding adult treatment-seekers in particular. This preregistered study responds to the gap in research by qualitatively investigating the reasons for treatment-seeking with 110 participants who had sought help for their videogame play from a Finnish treatment program. We applied template analysis to the open-ended data, which consist of the participants’ personal accounts regarding their problems. Additionally, we report the game titles that the participants had problems with, as well as Internet Gaming Disorder Test (IGDT-10) scores, which were measured from 89 participants. The template analysis suggested five themes, which cover the main reasons for treatment-seeking: social reasons, existential reasons, practical reasons, self-perceived addiction, and wish for support. Many of these themes overlap with the ICD-11 description of gaming disorder, but several issues, such as loss of meaning and financial harms, are not part of the current diagnosis. The average IGDT-10 score among participants was 3.86 (SD = 2.55) and 37 (42%) individuals met the disorder cutoff (5.00). Numerous videogames with different designs were mentioned as sources of problems, of which 26 were mentioned more than once. The study indicates that adults seek treatment for many kinds of games and gaming-related problems, including but not limited to those, which are described part of the ICD-11 gaming disorder diagnoses. We recommend both researchers and practitioners to implement an expanded perspective on gaming behaviors, acknowledging that adults may seek treatment for diverse gaming-related problems, some of which not necessarily relevant to gaming disorder or mental disorders in general.",despite gaming disorder diagnosable international classification diseases international classification diseases new mental disorder addictive behaviors little known concrete reasons people seek treatment videogame play current literature mainly based children adolescents strong need better understanding adult treatmentseekers particular preregistered study responds gap research qualitatively investigating reasons treatmentseeking participants sought help videogame play finnish treatment program applied template analysis openended data consist participants personal accounts regarding problems additionally report game titles participants problems internet gaming disorder test internet gaming disorder test scores measured participants template analysis suggested themes cover main reasons treatmentseeking social reasons existential reasons practical reasons selfperceived addiction wish support themes overlap international classification diseases description gaming disorder issues loss meaning financial harms current diagnosis average internet gaming disorder test score participants standard deviation individuals met disorder cutoff numerous videogames different designs mentioned sources problems mentioned study indicates adults seek treatment kinds games gamingrelated problems including limited described international classification diseases gaming disorder diagnoses recommend researchers practitioners implement expanded perspective gaming behaviors acknowledging adults seek treatment diverse gamingrelated problems necessarily relevant gaming disorder odds ratio mental disorders general

Sverdrup","People spend a lot of time and energy playing videogames (Kapp in The gamification of learning and instruction: game-based methods and strategies for training and education. Pfeiffer an imprint of Wiley, San Francisco, 2012), and as a result, gamification has grown from a buzzword into a discipline. Since 2012, the authors have experimented with system thinking as a methodology for developing gamification and will present examples in this article. The primary objectives are to study how system thinking can be used to understand, design, develop and document gamifications, and how psychology and pedagogics can be integrated in the process to enhance the learning. This is an observational case study that gives examples of how students (i) use system thinking to understand and clarify the gamification case using system analysis and (ii) use system dynamics to simulate cases and predict user responses. Students begin system analysis once the gamification idea is developed and their goals and the case parameters are established, and it includes making casual loop diagrams, flow charts, and reference behavior patterns. Students then find and experiment with numerical data for the case and use system dynamics to simulate the gamification and predict the user results. The pedagogy is problem based and grounded in traditional problem-based learning and situated learning. This article shows how system thinking allows students and professionals to develop a deeper and more tangible understanding of the research materials and presumptions they have when engaging in any given gamification scenario. System thinking also provides tools to test research material and hypotheses in a more structured, manageable, and palpable way. Although we have discovered several ways system thinking can benefit gamification design, the research has also revealed new areas where system thinking could be explored further.",people spend lot time energy playing videogames kapp gamification learning instruction gamebased methods strategies training education pfeiffer imprint wiley san francisco result gamification grown buzzword discipline authors experimented thinking methodology developing gamification present examples article primary objectives study thinking used understand design develop document gamifications psychology pedagogics integrated process enhance learning observational case study gives examples students use thinking understand clarify gamification case using analysis ii use dynamics simulate cases predict user responses students begin analysis gamification idea developed goals case parameters established includes making casual loop diagrams flow charts reference behavior patterns students experiment numerical data case use dynamics simulate gamification predict user results pedagogy problem based grounded traditional problembased learning situated learning article shows thinking allows students professionals develop deeper tangible understanding research materials presumptions engaging given gamification scenario thinking provides tools test research material hypotheses structured manageable palpable way discovered ways thinking benefit gamification design research revealed new areas thinking explored

Findings from previous studies indicate videogames can be inexpensive tools that help improve hand–eye coordination, coordination of 3-D movements with 2-D images, and spatial orientation. In the context of robotic-assisted knee arthroscopy using a MAKO robotic arm, this study explored performance and subjective experiences of novices (N = 104) with a fake bone shaving task at a public event. Participants’ performance was measured based on how much of the bone they successfully shaved. Findings showed that duration of videogame play per week was negatively related to performance with the robotic arm. Male and female participants performed similarly on the bone shaving task, and reported similar difficulty with and enjoyment of the task. However, female participants who played videogames performed better than those who did not play videogames. Participants who were younger than 11 had the worst performance and the most difficulty with the robotic arm. Overall, the findings indicate that the effect of videogame experience on the performance with the robotic arm may differ based on gender and age.

Our results show that, in general, an increasingly frequent use of the Internet has a negative influence on students’ academic achievement progression, with higher use of instant messaging applications being particularly linked to girls’ poorer mathematics academic performance progression. This negative influence may be a consequence of replacing time to academic activities (e.g., reading books or homework) with time using the Internet, which can also ultimately lead students to adopt unhealthy study habits that can affect their future academic success. Furthermore, we find that there is not a negative impact of playing videogames on the mathematics competence, as the development of spatial-visual (digital) skills possibly counterbalances the negative influence of time substitution between academically oriented tasks and the Internet.",present research analyses impact time spent internet primary school rd th grade students academic progression terms test scores order correlational analysis applied time fixedeffects estimation using recent longitudinal database students spanish region canary islands results general increasingly frequent use internet negative influence students academic achievement progression higher use instant messaging applications particularly linked girls poorer mathematics academic performance progression negative influence consequence replacing time academic activities reading books odds ratio homework time using internet ultimately lead students adopt unhealthy study habits affect future academic success furthermore negative impact playing videogames mathematics competence development spatialvisual digital skills possibly counterbalances negative influence time substitution academically oriented tasks internet

Autostereoscopic monitors offer the possibility of obtaining this 3D visualization without the need for extra device. This fact makes them more attractive to videogame developers. However, the configuration of the cameras that make it possible to obtain an immersive 3D visualization inside the game is still an open problem. In this paper, some system configurations that create autostereoscopic visualization in a 3D game engine were evaluated to obtain a good accommodation of the user experience with the game. To achieve this, user tests that take into account the movement of the player were carried out to evaluate different camera configurations, namely, dynamic and static converging optical axis and parallel optical axis. The purpose of these tests is to evaluate the user experience regarding visual discomfort resulting from the movement of the objects, with the purpose of assessing the preference for one configuration or the other. The results show that the users tend to have a preference trend for the parallel optical axis configuration set. This configuration seems to be optimal because the area where the moving objects are focused is deeper than in the other configurations.",stereoscopic devices popular day d visualization displays offer used videogame designers enhance users game experience autostereoscopic monitors offer possibility obtaining d visualization need extra device fact makes attractive videogame developers configuration cameras make possible obtain immersive d visualization inside game open problem paper configurations create autostereoscopic visualization d game engine evaluated obtain good accommodation user experience game achieve user tests account movement player carried evaluate different camera configurations dynamic static converging optical axis parallel optical axis purpose tests evaluate user experience regarding visual discomfort resulting movement objects purpose assessing preference configuration odds ratio results users tend preference trend parallel optical axis configuration set configuration optimal area moving objects focused deeper configurations

The sample consisted of 439 students from Compulsory Secondary Education, (238 boys and 201 girls), aged between 13 and 18. Exposure to video games was assessed through an author-elaborated questionnaire, violence justification, and pathological video-gaming were evaluated with the Exposure to Violence Questionnaire and the Assessment of Pathological Computer-Gaming, respectively, and CPV was assessed through the Child-to-Parent Aggression Questionnaire. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that pathological video-gaming and, specially, justification of violence, were related to the perpetration of CPV against both mothers and fathers. However, a relationship of exposure to violent video games and violence on TV with the perpetration of CPV was not found.

The authors searched PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for articles published between 2000 and January 2021. Quantitative and qualitative studies that reported on outcomes related to learners’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes following an intervention with virtual patients in undergraduate psychiatry education were reviewed. Outcomes were thematically compared, and a narrative synthesis of the different outcomes and effectiveness was provided. Of 7856 records identified, 240 articles were retrieved for full-text review and 46 articles met all inclusion criteria. There were four broad types of virtual patient interventions: case-based presentation (n = 17), interactive virtual patient scenarios (n = 14), standardized virtual patients (n = 10), and virtual patient videogames (n = 5). The thematic analysis revealed that virtual patients in psychiatry education have been used for learners to construe knowledge about symptomatology and psychopathology, develop interpersonal and clinical communicative skills, and to increase self-efficacy and decrease stigmatizing attitudes towards psychiatric patients. In comparison with no intervention, traditional teaching, and text-based interventions, virtual patients were associated with higher learning outcomes. However, the results did not indicate any superiority of virtual patients over non-technological simulation. Virtual patients in psychiatry education offer opportunities for students from different health disciplines to build knowledge, practice skills, and improve their attitudes towards individuals with mental illness.

Perceived parental psychological control and the risk of internet gaming disorder in adolescents: a cross-sectional study,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-05951-4,18 April 2024,"Nazan Turan, Afra Alkan, Yasemin Çekiç","It is stated that parental psychological control (PC), which appears to hinder psychological development in children and adolescents, is associated with internet gaming disorder (IGD). However, parenting styles and practices vary across cultures. For this reason, to determine the risk of IGD in adolescents who are in the process of psychological development and to prevent it at an early stage, there is a need to better understand the effect of PC on the development of IGD. In this context, this study aims to examine the impact of perceived parental psychological control on the risk of Internet gaming disorder in Turkish adolescents. A cross-sectional design was used. The sample group consisted of 4498 students from eight public high schools in Turkey. Participant Information Form, the Psychological Control Scale, and the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale Short Form were used for collecting data. Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the risk of IGD increased as maternal disrespect-maternal psychological control and father disrespect scores increased. Paternal psychological control score had no significant effect on IGD risk. In the multivariate model, age, father’s education level, spending money on games, time spent playing daily games on weekdays and weekends, and father’s psychological score were found to be associated with IGD risk. The effects of maternal disrespect and maternal psychological control scores on the IGD risk varied according to the number of siblings and the education level of the mother.

Its main consequences are the loss of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity of the amblyopic eye and binocular vision impairments. During the last years videogames have been used as a therapeutic tool for amblyopia with the inconclusive results. The present work has assessed the effectiveness of a virtual reality videogame (AmbliOK®) in the neurorehabilitation of four adult clinical cases with anisometropic amblyopia. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereopsis and interocular suppression were assessed before, during, immediately after, one month and one year (in one patient) after the training. The intervention was conducted along four weeks (10 h) and yielded the variable results. In general, all patients showed an improvement in visual functions although not all ameliorated in the same way. Visual acuity measures improved in all patients, falling outside the amblyopia criterion at the end of the treatment. However, the improvement was not maintained one month later in two patients. Contrast sensitivity progressively improved for the amblyopic and the fellow eyes with all patients showing better results one month after the treatment. The patient assessed one year after still showed better results than in the baseline. Patients showing bad stereopsis in the baseline reached a performance considered normal one month and even one year after the treatment.

The present study comprised 281 university students (148 females and 133 males) who had been playing digital videogames for at least six months. The measures used included the Risk Behaviors Scale, Digital Game Addiction Scale, and Family Sense of Coherence Scale-Short Form. Analysis demonstrated that risky behavior, gaming addiction, and family sense of coherence predicted gender with 76.5% accuracy. In other words, risky behaviors, gaming addiction, and family sense of coherence scores can predict a high probability that an individual is male or female. More specifically, risky behaviors (school dropout, antisocial behaviors, alcohol use, smoking, and eating habits) and gaming addiction contributed significantly to the classification of an individual being male or female.

The RI-CLPM results showed a stable link between symptoms of gaming disorder and depression at the between-person level for both children and adolescents. At the within-person level, among children, depressive symptoms positively predicted subsequent gaming disorder symptoms, but gaming disorder symptoms were not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms at this level. Among adolescents, there was no significant cross-lagged effect between symptoms of gaming disorder and depression at the within-person level. Additionally, there was no significant cross-lagged effect between normal videogame use and depressive symptoms in either cohort. These results highlight the different effects of normal videogame use and gaming disorder symptoms associated with depressive symptoms. The different effects on children and adolescents underscore the importance of considering the different developmental stages in the study of gaming and mental health outcomes.",previous studies shown close relationship gaming disorder depressive symptoms measured normal videogame use symptoms gaming disorder depressive symptoms concurrently longitudinal dynamics variables remain unclear study used demographic cohorts examine longitudinal relationship gaming depressive symptoms children n girls mage standard deviation years adolescents n girls mage standard deviation years random intercept crosslagged panel models response inhibitionclpms employed distinguish betweenperson levels gaming depressive symptoms response inhibitioncrosslagged panel model results showed stable link symptoms gaming disorder depression betweenperson level children adolescents withinperson level children depressive symptoms positively predicted subsequent gaming disorder symptoms gaming disorder symptoms significant predictor depressive symptoms level adolescents significant crosslagged effect symptoms gaming disorder depression withinperson level additionally significant crosslagged effect normal videogame use depressive symptoms cohort results highlight different effects normal videogame use gaming disorder symptoms associated depressive symptoms different effects children adolescents underscore importance considering different developmental stages study gaming mental health outcomes
Online Gaming Addiction and Basic Psychological Needs Among Adolescents: The Mediating Roles of Meaning in Life and Responsibility,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-022-00994-9,10 January 2023,"Alican Kaya, Nuri Türk, Hasan Batmaz, Mark D. Griffiths","Individuals whose basic needs are naturally satisfied are much less dependent on their environment and more autonomous. Basic psychological needs (i.e., the general motivators of human actions) are significant predictors of online gaming addiction. Moreover, it has been posited that meaning and responsibility in life are at the center of life from an existential point of view. Therefore, a hypothetical model was tested to examine the relationships between basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness), online gaming addiction, responsibility, and meaning in life. Data were collected from a sample of 546 participants. Mediation analysis was conducted, and the results indicated that basic psychological needs, online gaming addiction, responsibility, and meaning in life had significant negative and positive relationships. The findings indicated that responsibility and meaning in life had a serial mediating effect in the relationship between basic psychological needs and online gaming addiction. The findings also showed that the inverse relationship between online gaming addiction and basic psychological needs was at least partially explained by meaning in life and responsibility. The results of the present study are of great importance and suggest that interventions to satisfy the basic psychological needs of adolescents may help prevent online gaming addiction.",individuals basic needs naturally satisfied dependent environment autonomous basic psychological needs general motivators human actions significant predictors online gaming addiction posited meaning responsibility life center life existential point view hypothetical model tested examine relationships basic psychological needs autonomy competence relatedness online gaming addiction responsibility meaning life data collected sample participants mediation analysis conducted results indicated basic psychological needs online gaming addiction responsibility meaning life significant negative positive relationships findings indicated responsibility meaning life serial mediating effect relationship basic psychological needs online gaming addiction findings showed inverse relationship online gaming addiction basic psychological needs partially explained meaning life responsibility results present study great importance suggest interventions satisfy basic psychological needs adolescents help prevent online gaming addiction

Griffiths, Cheng Guo","Despite growing concerns regarding the development of gaming disorder symptoms among adolescents, the longitudinal relationship between school factors and gaming disorder symptoms remains far from being fully understood. This two-year longitudinal study examined the relationship between school climate perceptions, academic achievement, and gaming disorder symptoms among three distinct demographic cohorts: preadolescents (n = 1513; 46.9% girls, Mage = 10.64 years, SD = 0.56), early adolescents (n = 1771; 48.3% girls, Mage = 13.54 years, SD = 0.70), and late adolescents (n = 2385; 50.1% girls, Mage = 16.41 years, SD = 0.59). A four-wave study was conducted (six months apart) using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) to separate the within-person (state level) from the between-person (trait level) effects. The results obtained from the RI-CLPMs indicated that fluctuations in school climate perceptions negatively predicted subsequent changes in gaming disorder symptoms among preadolescents at the within-person level, but not among early and late adolescents. Fluctuations relating to gaming disorder symptoms also negatively predicted subsequent changes regarding academic achievement in late adolescents, but not in preadolescents and early adolescents. The effect of school-related factors on gaming disorder symptoms varies across different developmental stages. While preadolescents may represent a particularly susceptible subgroup for gaming disorder in terms of being predicted by their school environment, late adolescents appear to be more vulnerable to predictors of gaming disorder symptoms. The current study also discusses the implications of school-wide programs aimed at improving school climate and preventing the development of gaming disorder symptoms during key developmental periods.",despite growing concerns regarding development gaming disorder symptoms adolescents longitudinal relationship school factors gaming disorder symptoms remains far fully understood twoyear longitudinal study examined relationship school climate perceptions academic achievement gaming disorder symptoms distinct demographic cohorts preadolescents n girls mage years standard deviation early adolescents n girls mage years standard deviation late adolescents n girls mage years standard deviation fourwave study conducted months apart using random intercept crosslagged panel models response inhibitionclpms separate withinperson state level betweenperson trait level effects results obtained response inhibitionclpms indicated fluctuations school climate perceptions negatively predicted subsequent changes gaming disorder symptoms preadolescents withinperson level early late adolescents fluctuations relating gaming disorder symptoms negatively predicted subsequent changes regarding academic achievement late adolescents preadolescents early adolescents effect schoolrelated factors gaming disorder symptoms varies different developmental stages preadolescents represent particularly susceptible subgroup gaming disorder terms predicted school environment late adolescents appear vulnerable predictors gaming disorder symptoms current study discusses implications schoolwide programs aimed improving school climate preventing development gaming disorder symptoms key developmental periods

Interactive fiction allows the audience to make choices, resulting in many different possible fictions within each interactive fiction, unlike in literary fiction where there is just one. Adequately capturing this feature of interactive fiction requires us to address familiar issues regarding impossible fiction and the nature of time in fiction. Truth in interactive fiction thus requires a complex account to capture its multitude of fictions. It is argued that a full account of truth in interactive fiction requires distinguishing two works for each interactive fiction, which contain distinct fictional truths. The actual work encompasses what is in fact represented as fictional (hence mistakes can be fictionally true in this work), whilst in the implied work, truth in fiction is governed by authorial intention, hence mistakes are not fictionally true.

The reasons and motivations for playing greatly contribute to its popularity. Escapism and avoidance coping strategies have been studied extensively and conceptualized as motives to play. A growing research base has demonstrated a strong association between these motives to play and negative gaming outcomes. Consequently, the aim of the present systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of avoidance coping and escape motives in problematic online gaming. A systematic literature search was carried out using academic databases and a total of 26 empirical studies met the inclusion criteria. The results show that escapism and avoidance coping represent both a predictor of IGD and play a mediating role between many psychological factors (e.g., self-esteem, loneliness, self-concept, anxiety) and problematic online gaming. However, the review also highlights the paucity of longitudinal studies that hinder the determination of the causal direction of these associations. Despite this limitation, the evidence has important implication for developing more effective prevention programs and clinical interventions.",past decades research internet gaming disorder internet gaming disorder markedly increased worldwide spread online videogames reasons motivations playing greatly contribute popularity escapism avoidance coping strategies studied extensively conceptualized motives play growing research base demonstrated strong association motives play negative gaming outcomes consequently artificial intelligence medicine present systematic review provide comprehensive overview role avoidance coping escape motives problematic online gaming systematic literature search carried using academic databases total empirical studies met inclusion criteria results escapism avoidance coping represent predictor internet gaming disorder play mediating role psychological factors selfesteem loneliness selfconcept anxiety problematic online gaming review highlights paucity longitudinal studies hinder determination causal direction associations despite limitation evidence important implication developing effective prevention programs clinical interventions

The market explosion and the great variety make digital game cataloguing and classification challenging issues whose effectiveness can advance scientific research and address design, development and distribution. Firstly, the present study reviews previous cataloguing for video and serious games through systematic literature review and, joining together the findings from the literature review, develops a unified cataloguing model based on five definitions. This model can aid designers in tailoring their applications and contribute to disseminating game design knowledge in academic research. Then, a matrix that correlates design principles and the cataloguing model’s metadata is applied to the cataloguing model, obtaining a unified classification system. Together, they offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the multifaceted landscape of digital games, addressing the limitations of existing domain-specific approaches and providing a versatile tool for game designers. Research validation exploits a two-stage cluster analysis using agglomerative hierarchical and k-means clustering on the data extracted from a sample of digital games. The results show the framework's effectiveness in categorizing digital games without a clear-cut distinction between video and serious games. The system's application in real-world scenarios suggests its potential to guide game development. Future work will refine the proposal based on feedback from digital game designers, expanding the research scope to include a broader range of games.",digital games industry grown exponentially diversification games increasing multiplicity user target base market explosion great variety make digital game cataloguing classification challenging issues effectiveness advance scientific research address design development distribution firstly present study reviews previous cataloguing video games systematic literature review joining findings literature review develops unified cataloguing model based definitions model aid designers tailoring applications contribute disseminating game design knowledge academic research matrix correlates design principles cataloguing models metadata applied cataloguing model obtaining unified classification offer comprehensive framework understanding multifaceted landscape digital games addressing limitations existing domainspecific approaches providing versatile tool game designers research validation exploits twostage cluster analysis using agglomerative hierarchical kmeans clustering data extracted sample digital games results frameworks effectiveness categorizing digital games clearcut distinction video games systems application realworld scenarios suggests potential guide game development future work refine proposal based feedback digital game designers expanding research scope include broader range games

However, the interaction of GD with risk and protective factors has rarely been examined from a network analysis perspective. Therefore, the present study examined the relationships between GD, risk factors (i.e., social anxiety and fear of missing out), and protective factors (i.e., resilience, authenticity, and family closeness) utilizing a network analysis approach among a sample of Chinese university students. A cross-sectional study with 1364 participants was performed using the Gaming Disorder Test, the short version of Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), the Chinese Trait-State Fear of Missing Out Scale (T-SFoMOSC), the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the Authenticity Scale, and a single item assessing family closeness. Social anxiety, FoMO, and two factors of authenticity (i.e., self-alienation and accepting external influence) had positive relationship with GD, while resilience, authentic living, and family closeness had negative relationship with GD. Social anxiety was identified as the core node in the domain-level network. The item “continuation or escalation of gaming” (gd3) and the item “gaming problems” (gd4) constituted the highest edge weight in the facet-level network. The network comparison demonstrated there were no significant differences in relation to network structures and global strengths between gender. The findings suggest bivariate relationships among GD, risk factors (i.e., social anxiety and fear of missing out), and protective factors (i.e., resilience, authenticity, and family closeness). Interventions for GD must be considered through preventing risk factors and increasing protective factors including improving the gaming motivation and maladaptive cognition to decrease negative emotion (e.g., social anxiety and FoMO), enhancing resilience, authentic living and parent–child relationship, as well as decreasing self-alienation and accepting external influence.",research demonstrated risk protective factors gaming disorder generalized disorder identified interaction generalized disorder risk protective factors rarely examined network analysis perspective present study examined relationships generalized disorder risk factors social anxiety fear missing protective factors resilience authenticity family closeness utilizing network analysis approach sample chinese university students crosssectional study participants performed using gaming disorder test short version social interaction anxiety scale social interaction anxiety scale chinese traitstate fear missing scale tsfomosc brief resilience scale brief resilience scale authenticity scale single item assessing family closeness social anxiety fomo factors authenticity selfalienation accepting external influence positive relationship generalized disorder resilience authentic living family closeness negative relationship generalized disorder social anxiety identified core node domainlevel network item continuation odds ratio escalation gaming gd item gaming problems gd constituted highest edge weight facetlevel network network comparison demonstrated significant differences relation network structures global strengths gender findings suggest bivariate relationships generalized disorder risk factors social anxiety fear missing protective factors resilience authenticity family closeness interventions generalized disorder considered preventing risk factors increasing protective factors including improving gaming motivation maladaptive cognition decrease negative emotion social anxiety fomo enhancing resilience authentic living parentchild relationship decreasing selfalienation accepting external influence

Nevertheless, whether such changes are correlated with brain functional connectivity modifications outlasting the training period is not known. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in order to quantify acute and long-lasting connectivity changes following a sustained gaming experience on a first-person shooter (FPS) game. Thirty-five healthy participants were assigned to either a gaming or a control group prior to the acquisition of resting state fMRI data and a comprehensive cognitive assessment at baseline (T0), post-gaming (T1) and at a 3 months’ follow-up (T2). Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analysis revealed a significant greater connectivity between left thalamus and left parahippocampal gyrus in the gamer group, both at T1 and at T2. Furthermore, a positive increase in the rs-FC between the cerebellum, Heschl’s gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus paralleled improvements of in-gaming performance. In addition, baseline rs-FC of left supramarginal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum were associated with individual changes in videogame performance. Finally, enhancement of perceptual and attentional measures was observed at both T1 and T2, which correlated with a pattern of rs-FC changes in bilateral occipito-temporal regions belonging to the visual and attention fMRI networks.

We report a proof of concept study, especially useful for strabismic patients and/or those with reduced or null stereoacuity. Our novel VR PL strategy is based on a principled approach which included aligning and balancing the perceptual input to the two eyes, dichoptic tasks, exposure to large disparities, scaffolding depth cues and perception for action. We recruited ten adults with normal vision and ten with binocular impairments. Participants played two novel PL games (DartBoard and Halloween) using a VR-HMD. Each game consisted of three depth cue scaffolding conditions, starting with non-binocular and binocular cues to depth and ending with only binocular disparity. All stereo-anomalous participants improved in the game and most (9/10) showed transfer to clinical and psychophysical stereoacuity tests (mean stereoacuity changed from 569 to 296 arc seconds, P < 0.0001). Stereo-normal participants also showed in-game improvement, which transferred to psychophysical tests (mean stereoacuity changed from 23 to a ceiling value of 20 arc seconds, P = 0.001). We conclude that a VR PL approach based on depth cue scaffolding may provide a useful method for improving stereoacuity, and the in-game performance metrics may provide useful insights into principles for effective treatment of stereo anomalies.",stereopsis valuable feature human visual perception impaired odds ratio absent amblyopia andodds ratio strabismus improved perceptual learning psycholinguistics videogames development consumer virtual reality virtual reality provide useful tool improving stereovision report proof concept study especially useful strabismic patients andodds ratio reduced odds ratio null stereoacuity novel virtual reality psycholinguistics strategy based principled approach included aligning balancing perceptual input eyes dichoptic tasks exposure large disparities scaffolding depth cues perception action recruited adults normal vision binocular impairments participants played novel psycholinguistics games dartboard halloween using virtual realityheadmounted display game consisted depth cue scaffolding conditions starting nonbinocular binocular cues depth ending binocular disparity stereoanomalous participants improved game showed transfer clinical psychophysical stereoacuity tests mean stereoacuity changed arc seconds p stereonormal participants showed ingame improvement transferred psychophysical tests mean stereoacuity changed ceiling value arc seconds p conclude virtual reality psycholinguistics approach based depth cue scaffolding provide useful method improving stereoacuity ingame performance metrics provide useful insights principles effective treatment stereo anomalies

The aim of this study was to analyse which sociodemographic variables, COVID-19 exposure variables and lifestyles to cope with stress variables predicted anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional design was performed with a sample of 3356 Spanish women participating in the Riseup-PPD-COVID-19 study. These participants completed an online survey composed of measures of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (EPDS), and PTSD related to COVID-19 (Checklist DSM-5), as well as demographics, exposure to COVID-19, and lifestyles to cope with stress. Regarding results, 47.2% showed depression and a third reported anxiety, whereas moderate scores were observed in PTSD symptoms. The most commonly used strategies to cope with stress in the COVID-19 pandemic were talking with friends and family and increasing time with social networks. Better results in mental health were associated with coping strategies such as talking with family and friends or participating in family activities, physical activity, sleeping well at night, eating healthier, and increasing personal care. Furthermore, poor results in mental health were observed in those participants who increased time with screens, ate fast food, reported substance use, and talked more frequently with health professionals. More symptoms were also observed in younger women, primiparous women, and those who reported more exposure to COVID-19.

Rubio-Arias, Alberto Verdejo-Herrero, Luis Andreu-Caravaca, Domingo J. Ramos-Campo","Objectives: To assess the potential of immersive virtual reality (IVR) in achieving moderate exercise intensity, and 2) to examine the acute effects of two IVR exergame sessions (BOXVR and Beat Saber), comparing them with the impact of traditional exercise on heart rate variability (HRV), perceived effort, delayed onset muscle soreness, motivation, and sleep. Materials and methods: A crossover design was used. The participants (n = 22) randomly performed two sessions of IVR and one session of moderate intensity physical activity, each session lasting 30 min. Heart Rate (HR) and HRV, Perceived Exertion Scale, Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, sleep quality, and perceived pain, were evaluated. Results: The cardiac response to the activities was significantly higher when participants performed traditional physical activity as compared to the BOXVR and Beat Saber games. Traditional training provided a different HRV response as compared to Beat Saber (LnRMSSD, p = 0.025; SDNN, p = 0.031). Although the sessions were planned for moderate intensity, BOXVR generated a moderate intensity (49.3% HRreserve), Beat Saber (29.6% HRreserve) a light one, and the Circuit session, a vigorous one (62.9% HRreserve). In addition, traditional training reported higher perceived exertion and pain with less enjoyment. Differences were observed between the exergames. BOXVR resulted in a lower cardiac response (HRmax and HRmean), and a higher perception of exertion and pain at 72 h. The sleep variables analyzed were not altered by any of the sessions. Conclusions: BOXVR and traditional training can lead to moderate intensity physical activity. However, traditional training could result in lower adherence to physical exercise programs, as it was perceived as more intense and less enjoyable.",objectives assess potential immersive virtual reality immersive virtual reality achieving moderate exercise intensity examine acute effects immersive virtual reality exergame sessions specific vr fitness game beat saber comparing impact traditional exercise heart rate variability heart rate variability perceived effort delayed onset muscle soreness motivation sleep materials methods crossover design used participants n randomly performed sessions immersive virtual reality session moderate intensity physical activity session lasting min heart rate heart rate heart rate variability perceived exertion scale intrinsic motivation inventory sleep quality perceived pain evaluated results cardiac response activities significantly higher participants performed traditional physical activity compared specific vr fitness game beat saber games traditional training provided different heart rate variability response compared beat saber lnrmssd p standard deviation normaltonormal intervals p sessions planned moderate intensity specific vr fitness game generated moderate intensity hrreserve beat saber hrreserve light circuit session vigorous hrreserve addition traditional training reported higher perceived exertion pain enjoyment differences observed exergames specific vr fitness game resulted lower cardiac response hrmax hrmean higher perception exertion pain h sleep variables analyzed altered sessions conclusions specific vr fitness game traditional training lead moderate intensity physical activity traditional training result lower adherence physical exercise programs perceived intense enjoyable

The Role of Self-Esteem in Protecting Against Cyber-Victimization and Gaming Disorder Symptoms Among Adolescents: A Temporal Dynamics Analysis,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-023-01890-8,30 October 2023,"Qian Nie, Mark D. Griffiths, Zhaojun Teng","Previous literature has suggested that victimization is linked to low self-esteem and increases the symptoms of gaming disorder. However, little is known about the intra-individual processes, and the temporal dynamics of cyber-victimization, self-esteem, and gaming disorder symptoms. To address this gap, a three-year longitudinal study was performed using data collected at six different time points from 4206 Chinese adolescents (aged 12–17 years; 50.4% boys). Results of random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) indicated that at the within-person level, the fluctuation in self-esteem weakly predicted late cyber-victimization, and the fluctuation of cyber-victimization also weakly predicted late self-esteem. Additionally, the current study identified an interactive effect between self-esteem and gaming disorder symptoms at the within-person level. Fluctuations in self-esteem negatively predicted late gaming disorder symptoms, and vice versa. However, when combining the three variables (i.e., cyber-victimization, self-esteem, and gaming disorder symptoms) into one RI-CLPM, the results did not support the mediation of self-esteem in the relationship between cyber-victimization and gaming disorder symptoms at the within-person level. Moreover, fluctuations in self-esteem negatively predicted late gaming disorder symptoms and cyber-victimization at the within-person level in the RI-CLPM.

"Cognitive, Metacognitive, Motivational, and Emotional Predictors of the Intensity of Internet Gaming Disorder among Adolescents",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11126-024-10075-w,01 July 2024,"Mehdi Akbari, Nima Mohammadaliha, Shahram Mohammadkhani, Mohammad Seydavi, Mark D. Griffiths","Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is multifaceted and can have significant negative consequences. The present study examined the contribution of cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, and emotional factors as predictors for IGD severity. In a cross-sectional study, 703 Iranian adolescents (36.8% females, mean age = 16.98 years [SD = 1.23]) completed an online survey. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, and emotional factors predicted 7.8%, 17.4%, 1.4%, and 1.9% of the variance in IGD symptoms, respectively. The findings indicated that the cognitive factors including some maladaptive cognitions, such as cognitive salience, regret, and perfectionism, and metacognitive factors including some maladaptive metacognitions (negative metacognitions regarding the uncontrollability of online gaming and negative metacognitions regarding the dangers of online gaming) were significant predictors of IGD severity, highlighting their importance in understanding and predicting problematic gaming behaviors. Although contributing to the variance in IGD, motivational factors (escape, coping, and skill development) and emotional factors including emotion regulation (especially reappraisal) played relatively smaller roles compared to cognitive and metacognitive factors. Of the examined predictive factors, metacognitions were the most important predictor of IGD severity. Exploratory moderator analyses showed significant interactions between three predictors of IGD (reappraisal, negative metacognitions, and cognitive salience) with loneliness, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Reappraisal was the most frequent predictor and had a significant interaction with these variables. Other predictors independently impacted IGD irrespective of the level of loneliness, stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms. Based on these findings, special attention to metacognitive, cognitive, emotional, and motivational factors is suggested in the treatment of IGD.",internet gaming disorder internet gaming disorder multifaceted significant negative consequences present study examined contribution cognitive metacognitive motivational emotional factors predictors internet gaming disorder severity crosssectional study iranian adolescents females mean age years standard deviation completed online survey hierarchical regression analysis showed cognitive metacognitive motivational emotional factors predicted variance internet gaming disorder symptoms respectively findings indicated cognitive factors including maladaptive cognitions cognitive salience regret perfectionism metacognitive factors including maladaptive metacognitions negative metacognitions regarding uncontrollability online gaming negative metacognitions regarding dangers online gaming significant predictors internet gaming disorder severity highlighting importance understanding predicting problematic gaming behaviors contributing variance internet gaming disorder motivational factors escape coping skill development emotional factors including emotion regulation especially reappraisal played relatively smaller roles compared cognitive metacognitive factors examined predictive factors metacognitions important predictor internet gaming disorder severity exploratory moderator analyses showed significant interactions predictors internet gaming disorder reappraisal negative metacognitions cognitive salience loneliness stress anxiety depressive symptoms reappraisal frequent predictor significant interaction variables predictors independently impacted internet gaming disorder irrespective level loneliness stress anxiety odds ratio depressive symptoms based findings special attention metacognitive cognitive emotional motivational factors suggested treatment internet gaming disorder

Specifically, it involved a single condition (n = 93) receiving an intervention that comprised six short mindfulness sessions in VR. Measurements were taken of participants’ state mindfulness and emotional state immediately before and after the implementation of each VR environment. Sense of presence was measured subsequent to each VR environment. Furthermore, participants were asked to rate their expectations for at baseline and satisfaction with the experience after the intervention. Participants significantly improved both state mindfulness and emotional states, and they reported a moderate-to-strong sense of presence in each of the VR environments.

Thirty-four participants completed an IVR driving game including 4 GPS conditions (No GPS; audio GPS; visual GPS; audio–visual GPS). After driving one of the routes in one of the 4 GPS conditions, participants were asked to drive to a target landmark they had previously encountered. The audio–visual GPS condition returned more accurate performance than the visual and no GPS condition. General orientation ability predicted the distance to the target landmark for the visual and the audio–visual GPS conditions, while landmark preference predicted performance in the audio GPS condition. Finally, the variability in end distance to the target landmark was significantly reduced in the audio–visual GPS condition when compared to the visual and audio GPS conditions.

Ninety-seven meta-analytic reviews were included, which examined a wide range of populations with different clinical conditions and ages. Regarding the reporting, information about the search of the studies, screening procedure, or data collection was detailed by most reviews. However, authors usually failed to report other aspects such as the specific meta-analytic parameters, the formula used to compute the effect sizes, or the data from primary studies that were used to compute the effect sizes. Although some of these practices have improved over the years, others remained the same. Moreover, examining the eligibility criteria of the reviews revealed a great heterogeneity in aspects such as the training duration, age cut-offs, or study designs that were considered. Preregistered meta-analyses often specified poorly how they would deal with the multiplicity of data or assess publication bias in their protocols, and some contained non-disclosed deviations in their eligibility criteria or outcomes of interests.

Following a qualitative case-study approach, this study sought to shed light on this phenomenon through examining expert interviews with supporters and team members of an overfunded crowdfunding project considered a critical case. The results are divided into three phases that differentiate characteristics ascribed to the crowd, the project, and the communication. The main findings highlight the central role of the project founders’ reputation and experience, that a positive sentiment among the crowd towards the project must be encouraged and maintained and that the core target group must be correctly identified and attracted. This core target group is crucial for attracting a broader audience, a mechanism that is supported if the project benefits from network effects. A narrative of the project as a vision or ‘dream’ of the project founders thereby contributes to creating a hype and ‘social buzz’.
